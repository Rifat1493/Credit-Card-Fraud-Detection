Brief Hospital Course:
24 yo female with ESRD on HD, malignant hypertension with hx of
intracerebral hemorrhage, SLE, chronic abdominal pain, and SVC
syndrome admitted due to hypertensive urgency after developing
N/V and being unable to take her po medications.

# Hypertensive urgency: The patient was admitted to the MICU the
night of admission where she was placed on a labetolol drip and
her home medications were restarted. head CT was negative for
intracranial bleed.  She was continued on her home regimen of
Aliskiren 150 mg po bid, Clonidine 0.4 mg/24 hr Patch Weekly,
Labetalol 1000 mg po TID, Nifedipine 60 mg Tablet Sustained
Release QPM and 90 mg Tablet Sustained Release QAM, and
Hydralazine 100 mg PO Q8H.  During her stay her blood pressure
fluctuated, occasionally becoming relatively low due to grouping
of her medications together.  Blood cultures were sent but have
been no growth to date and she remained without signs of
infection (afebrile with no leukocytosis).  She was discharged
on her home regimen.

# Nausea/vomiting: The patient did not experience further
vomiting, but occasionally complained of nausea.  The cause of
her nausea was unclear.  She was able to tolerate po intake
prior to discharge.

# Abdominal pain/Diarrhea: The patient has chronic abdominal
pain with previous negative workups. During this hospitalization
her pain was at its baseline. Since admission she denied
diarrhea.  She was continued on her outpatient regimen of [**2-14**] mg
po dilaudid q4h as needed.

# ESRD on HD: She was hyperkalemic in the emergency room and was
given kayexalate.  She underwent two sessions of dialysis during
this hospitalization.

# SLE: Stable, without symptoms.  She was continued on 4 mg of
prednisone daily.

# History of thrombotic events/SVC syndrome: She is
anticoagulated with warfarin as an outpatient, however her INR
was subtherapeutic on admission at 1.2. Previous documentation
in OMR states she does not need to be bridged while
subtherapeutic.  She was initally continued on coumadin 4 mg po
daily, however her INR rose quickly to the therapeutic range, so
this was decreased to 3 mg po daily.

# OSA: She is on CPAP at a setting of 7 as an outpatient and was
continued on this during her hospitalization.

REASON FOR TRANSFER:  Management of liver failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46 year old
woman with past medical history as listed below who was
transferred from [**Hospital 8**] Hospital for further management of
acute hepatitis.  She was in her usual state of health until
four days prior to admission there when she developed right
upper quadrant/epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting.  Family
members also reported that they thought that she looked
jaundiced.  Additionally, she reported chills and temperature
to 101 at home.  She denied any hematemesis, saying that when
she vomited that it was bilious.  Her stools were noted to be
[**Male First Name (un) 1658**] colored and smaller in caliber than usual.  She denied
any sick contacts or recent travel.  She had started no new
medications and denied the use of alcohol or intravenous drug
use.  Of note, she reported that her ex-husband (divorced
three years ago) had a history of hepatitis C.

At [**Hospital 8**] Hospital, right upper quadrant ultrasound on the
day of admission was initially normal.  Her transaminases
rose rapidly to the range of [**2146**] to 3000 with INR of 2.1 at
the time of transfer.  Hepatitis serologies and autoimmune
studies were sent, most of which were still pending at the
time of transfer.

At the time of admission to [**Hospital1 188**], she complained of continuing right upper quadrant
pain.  She denied further nausea, vomiting, chills or fever.
In addition, she reported a thirty pound weight gain over the
previous few months as well as increased abdominal girth over
the previous week.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Open cholecystectomy in [**2124**].
2.  Status post appendectomy.
3.  Depression.
4.  Multiple benign breast masses.

ALLERGIES:  Codeine.

MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF TRANSFER:
1.  Protonix.
2.  Morphine p.r.n.
3.  Klonopin 0.5 mg three times a day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her 21 year old
daughter and her father.  She reports ongoing smoking with
greater than thirty pack year history.  She has a history of
suicide attempts in the past by overdose with benzodiazepines
but denied again any active drug use.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Effexor.
2.  Percocet.
3.  Remeron.
4.  Vicodin.
5.  Trazodone.
6.  Neurontin.
7.  Compazine.

This list was obtained from the patient's local pharmacy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs revealed the
patient was afebrile at 98.2., heart rate 74, blood pressure
113/55, respiratory rate 12, oxygen saturation 97% in room
air.  Pertinent physical findings included that she was obese
and jaundiced.  She had scleral icterus.  Her heart and lung
examinations were without significant findings.  Her
abdominal examination revealed tenderness over the right
upper quadrant, liver palpable approximately 3.0 centimeters
below the costal margin.  Cholecystectomy scar was noted.
She had no stigmata of chronic liver disease or elevated
portal pressures. She had no asterixis on examination.
Extremities revealed no palmar erythema, cyanosis, clubbing
or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, complete blood count was
unremarkable.  Chem7 revealed sodium of 136, potassium 5.1,
blood urea nitrogen and creatinine within normal limits.  INR
on admission was 2.1.  Liver function tests revealed ALT
2481, AST 3416, alkaline phosphatase 203, total bilirubin
16.3, direct bilirubin 9.9, total protein 5.3, albumin 2.9.
Numerous serologies looking at possible causes of her liver
disease were still pending at the outside hospital at the
time of transfer.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Acute hepatitis - Upon admission, blood was sent for
numerous studies to determine the etiology of her acute
hepatitis.  Things that were examined included hepatitis A, B
and C serologies, hepatitis B and C viral loads, EBV, CMV,
HSV serologies, HIV, varicella, RPR, toxoplasma and
ceruloplasmin.  Ultimately, these results yielded an etiology
consistent with acute hepatitis B as her hepatitis B surface
antigen returned positive.  All other studies were negative.
She was treated supportively for her acute hepatitis B with
coagulation studies being followed very closely.  Her liver
enzymes remained stable.  On [**2149-5-16**], without any signs of
hepatic encephalopathy, the patient was transferred out of
the Intensive Care Unit to the medical floor.  While still in
the Intensive Care Unit and upon transfer to the floor, the
patient had been treated with Morphine including a PCA for
her severe abdominal pain.  On [**2149-5-18**], the patient became
acutely more encephalopathic and was transferred to the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit, placed on the transplant list
for possible liver transplant.  While awaiting a liver, the
patient admitted to recent intravenous drug use, specifically
the use of Heroin.  Her admission of illicit drug use
precluded her from getting a liver transplant and she was
transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit back to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  In the Medical Intensive
Care Unit, she continued to decline neurologically with
worsening encephalopathy, increasing asterixis and eventually
significant lethargy and obtundation.  Her INR continued to
elevate and, at the time of readmission to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, her INR was 6.8.  On [**2149-5-22**], the
patient's INR reached its highest point of 25.0.  At that
time, hematology was consulted regarding reversal of her INR.
It was recommended that she be given daily Vitamin K , fresh
frozen plasma, and cryoglobulins for fibrinogen less than 150
and Factor VII-A was suggested for acute bleeding or if any
procedure was needed to be performed.

On [**2149-5-24**], the patient's mental status deteriorated further
and she was ultimately intubated for airway support.
Neurosurgery was consulted at that time.  After reversal of
INR to normal levels, intracerebral pressure monitor (BOLT)
was placed for monitoring of her intracranial pressure.  Her
intracranial pressure was solid and maintained at level of
less than 25 with a cerebral perfusion pressure greater than
50.  At one point, her intracranial pressure rose to a level
of 24 at which time she was treated with 20 grams of
intravenous Mannitol.  In the interim, the patient had
developed acute renal failure and was essentially anuric
becoming incredibly volume overloaded with all the blood
products she was receiving.  Once the BOLT was placed, it was
necessary to maintain an INR of less than 1.5.  For this, she
received very frequent transfusions of fresh frozen plasma,
Factor VII-A, cryoglobulins and platelets for levels that
were less than 70,000.  Renal was consulted and CVVH was
instituted in the Intensive Care Unit for volume removal as
well as to help with the elevation in intracranial pressure.
This treatment continued until [**2149-5-30**], in that the patient
received frequent blood products and CVVH for volume removal.
The patient's platelets were found to fall precipitously and
Heparin dependent antibodies were checked finding that she
was HIT positive.  For this, Heparin could not be used in the
CVVH and the CVVH filter clotted.  Citrate was used
alternatively as an anticoagulant (see renal below) and
ultimately as the patient showed no signs of improvement in
her hepatic function, it was decided after a family meeting
on [**2149-5-30**], that once the CVVH filter clotted off again that
it would not be restarted.  That was the case on [**2149-5-30**],
after which time, CVVH was not restarted.  The patient had
her BOLT removed and has since been monitored for progressive
neurologic decline.  At the time of this dictation, there is
evidence of cerebral herniation in that her pupils are fixed
and dilated bilaterally.  She continues to be sedated on the
ventilator so the neurologic examination is difficult beyond
that, however, without any improvement in her liver synthetic
function, her prognosis is grime.  The patient was made ""Do
Not Resuscitate"" after a family meeting.

Liver enzymes have trended downward and are actually below
normal limits suggesting that hepatic function is not showing
any signs of return.

2.  Renal - As stated above, the patient developed acute
renal failure likely hepatorenal syndrome versus HEN as
microscopic examination of the urine reveals casts suggestive
thereof.  As above, CVVH was instituted to help with volume
overload as well as to aid in the treatment of intracranial
pressure with the administration of Mannitol.  Again, the
CVVH filter had clotted off and the patient was not receiving
Heparin.  Citrate was instituted as anticoagulant.  While on
Citrate, the patient's free calcium was noted to become very
low due to the binding of Citrate and she was repleted with a
constant infusion of Calcium Gluconate as well as Calcium
Chloride on a p.r.n. basis.  Daily laboratories revealed that
her body's total calcium was as high as 18.0 as it was
measuring the calcium bound to Citrate and though her free
calcium was within the normal range of 1.0 to 1.2.  When the
CVVH filter clotted on [**2149-5-30**], as above, it was decided
that it would not be restarted as the patient's prognosis and
hope for recovery was minimal.  Since CVVH has been
discontinued, the patient's creatinine has risen very rapidly
from 2.5 on the day of discontinuation to 4.5 on the day of
dictation.  She continues to be volume overloaded with
increasing potassium.

3.  Hematology - With worsening liver synthetic function, the
patient's coagulopathy was as above with her INR ultimately
reaching a level of 25.  With the placement of the
intracranial pressure monitor, it was necessary to keep the
patient's INR less than 1.5, platelets greater than 70,000,
fibrinogen greater than 150.  Appropriate blood products were
transfused on a p.r.n. basis to maintain those goals with
Factor VII-A being used frequently for INRs greater than 2.0
to 2.5. Because of its expense, Factor VII-A was reserved
only for when fresh frozen plasma was unable to correct the
INR on its own which was a frequent occurrence. After the
intracranial pressure monitor was removed, reversal of INR
was continued for 24 hours to minimize the chance of an
intracranial bleed.  Since discontinuation of INR control,
her INR has already risen to 6.1 eight hours after her last
dose of Factor VII-A.  No further blood products will be
given at this time unless the patient shows signs of active
bleeding.  On the day of this dictation, the patient's
hematocrit was 19.0, status post one unit of packed red blood
cells the day prior for the same hematocrit.  A source of
bleeding is unclear at this time.  It is possible the patient
is hemolyzing.  She will be transfused further packed red
blood cells today on [**2149-6-1**].

4.  Hypotension - With the patient's worsening encephalopathy
and liver failure as well as likely component of her
sedation, the patient was persistently hypotensive requiring
pressors to maintain her blood pressure.  Specifically, it
was important to maintain her cerebral perfusion pressure
(MAT minus intracranial pressure) of greater than 50.  For
this, she was on Levophed, Neo-Synephrine and Vasopressin.
The Neo-Synephrine was able to be weaned and the patient has
been continued to date on Levophed and Vasopressin.  After
the family meeting on [**2149-5-30**], it was determined that no
further pressors would be used, i.e., Neo-Synephrine would
not be restarted but Vasopressin and Levophed would be
continued and titrated as needed.

5.  Pulmonary - Once intubated, the patient developed
worsening oxygenation but chest x-ray was consistent with
adult respiratory distress syndrome.  She was ventilated with
low tidal volumes at high respiratory rates, as high as 34
for a number of days, with continuing poor oxygenation.  Over
time, her oxygenation did improve and at the time of this
dictation, she is still ventilated on assist control with a
tidal volume of 600 with a rate of only 22, pCO2 in the mid
30s and pO2 in the 80s to 100s.

6.  Acid base - The patient had a triple acidotic disturbance
with both a gap and nongap metabolic acidosis as well as
respiratory acidosis.  In order to compensate for this, she
was ventilated as above with respiratory rates as high as 34
to try to decrease her pCO2.

7.  FEN - As above, the patient was persistently volume
overloaded and her total volume in was minimized by
concentrating all fluids that she received.  Her calcium was
complicated by the Citrate and the CVVH fluid as above.  At
the time of this dictation, her potassium is rising since
CVVH has been off.  For nutrition, the patient had been
receiving tube feeds but was having problems with high
residuals.  Therefore, she has been maintained on TPN.

8.  Endocrine - The patient was found to be adrenally
insufficient by random cortisol and is being treated with
Hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous q8hours.  In addition,
because of her decrease in hepatic synthetic function,
decreased gluconate agenesis, the patient has had q2hour
fingerstick and treated with initially a D10 infusion
replaced by increased dextrose in her TPN with p.r.n. of D50
as needed for hypoglycemia.

The dictation covers the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course from
admission through [**2149-6-1**].  The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course will be dictated by the intern taking over
the Medical Intensive Care Unit service tomorrow.

Brief Hospital Course:
53 y.o. female with a history of lupus, fibromyalgia,
depression, osteoporosis, and migraines transferred from BIDNH
after presenting with methadone overdose and intubated for
airway protection, transfered to the floor after successful
extubation.
.
# Methadone Overdose:  Suicide attempt patient admitted to true
attempt.  She has history of prior suicide attempt three days
prior with tylenol.  Patient received charchoal at BIDNH, no
indication to repeat charcoal per toxicology.  Patient received
narcan at BIDNH as well.  Intubated for airway protection and
weaned successfully in the MICU.  Psychiatry and Toxicology
consulted and follwed.  As patient has a history of tylenol
ingestion, checked serial LFT's which were all within normal
limits.  As LFT's not abnomal did not administer mucomyst.
Monitored on telemetry and got daily EKG's to monitor QTc,
stable at 475 prior to discharge.  No prior recent EKG to
compare to.  Maintained with a 1:1 sitter.  She was kept under
section 12 for her safety.  Now that she is medically stable,
she will be transfered to an inpatient psychiatric facility for
evaluation and treatment.
.
# Leukocytosis:  resolved.  Per OSH reports there was a question
of aspiration.  CXR was negative for evidence of infiltrate.
Patient able to be extubated without difficulty.  Did not
initiate antibiotic therapy as leukocytosis resolved, patient
afebrile and not requiring 02 prior to discharge.
.
# SLE:  Discussed plan with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3057**].  Patient should
continue on hydroxychloroquine while inpatient, alternating
200mg QD with [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Chronic Pain:  History of chronic headaches, neck pain, and
bilateral upper extremity pain with some relief in the past with
nerve blocks.  Continued indomethacin only for pain control with
some relief.  [**Month (only) 116**] have to go back on other narcotics in the
future, however held methadone while inpatient considering
overdose.  Toxicology did not think that she would go into
withdrawls from holding methadone, but monitored closely for
signs of withdrawls, with none noted.
.
# Migraines:  Continued indomethacin.  Also used PRN Ativan for
nausea, initially IV, then switched to PO as zofran has concern
of effecting QT length. Therapeutic exchange for maxalt as not
on formulary, gave imitrex.  Will switch back to maxalt on
discharge.
.
#  Anemia:  Patient's Hct dropped from 32 on admission to 27 on
discharge to psychiatric facility.  Most likely patient has
dilutional changes from aggressive IV fluids, however will have
facility check Hct on Monday to confirm this has remained stable
or increased.  If Hct continues to decrease, patient will need
further workup regarding anemia, including possible GI etiology
as patient has taken many NSAIDs in the past.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
52yo F with hypertension and prior suicide attempts found
unresposive, believe to have overdosed on Clonazepam, Trazodone,
Seroquel.
.
# Clonazepam, Trazodone OD:
CT Head was performed to assess for midline shift due to edema
or fluid shifts, and was found to be negative.  Concern for
Trazodone OD (t1/2 = 7 hrs) was in EKG changes, seizures,
respiratory distress.  Treatment was supportive.  Concern for
Clonazepam OD (t1/2 = 30-40 hrs) was somnolence, confusion,
coma, diminished reflexes.  Treatment included monitoring of
respiration, pulse and blood pressure, general supportive
measures.  Intravenous fluids were administered to euvolemia,
and patient was intubated for airway protection.  Dialysis is of
no known value in these drug ODs.  Patient was intubated on
[**10-27**] AM on admission, and extubated on [**10-27**] AM without
weaning.  After extubation, vital signs were completely stable,
O2 saturation was 100% on room air, patient was communicating
clearly and asking questions, and was eating a regular diet and
drinking fluids without problems swallowing or choking.
.
Another concern was methadone which was found in urine tox
screen.  Patient stated that she did not know how she could have
taken methadone since she does not usually take methadone.  She
has not been prescribed methadone either for heroin addiction or
for pain control.  [**Name (NI) **] brother stated ""she will take
anything she can get her hands on"".  Patient denies taking
methadone.
.
Another concern was seroquel, of which patient states she took
12 tablets.  Supportive treatment was given.
.
Psych consult assessed patient on [**10-28**], and recommended
inpatient psych hospitalization.  Patient was agitated from
[**10-27**] to [**10-28**], stating that she wanted to leave repeatedly, and
that she needed to make her daughter's court date [**10-28**] at 9 am.
 Plan was to call code purple if patient attempted to leave.
Patient needs 1:1 sitter on floor.  Patient is medically cleared
to go directly from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to psych unit.
.
##  Respiratory failure [**1-5**] obtundation from overdose:
Patient was intubated [**10-27**] AM, extubated [**10-27**] AM without
weaning.  Mental status was wnl immediately after extubation,
vital signs stable, 100% O2 saturation on room air.

Pertinent Results:
TTE (Complete) Done [**2138-1-31**] at 1:58:07 PM
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is a moderate sized (0.8cm2) mass
in the left ventricular tract (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]), which is a possible
vegetation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal biventricular systolic function. A possible vegetation is
present in the left ventricular outflow tract, recommend
transesophageal echocardiography to further assess

Brief Hospital Course:
37 yo M with PMH of polysubstance abuse and diabetes, presenting
with heroin overdose and decreased respiratory rate, intubated
in the ED for continued poor respiratory effort combined with
combativeness and inability to protect airway.

# Respiratory failure: Patient was intubated in the emergency
department for inability to protect airway and combativeness and
transferred to the ICU.  Patient was found to have a pneumonia
most likely from aspiration on Chest X-ray.  He was initially
started on vancomycin and unasyn for concerns of aspiration and
MRSA.  He was extubated without incident on [**2138-1-31**], was found to
be stable on room air, and transferred to the general medicine
floor for further managment.  CXR repeated on the floor
continued to show RML/RLL infiltrate.  Sputum cultures showed
pansensitive coagulase positive staph.  Once possibility of
vegetation/endocarditis was ruled out with TEE, he was switched
to levofloxacin to complete treatment of his aspiration
pneumonia.  On discharge he has improved breath sounds and
saturating well on room air.

# Leukocytosis: Patient has multiple possible sources including
aspiration pneumonia and recent IV drug abuse.  Blood cultures
continue to show no growth to date.  Sputum culture grew
pansensitive coag negative staph.  TTE was concerning for a
possible vegetation in the LVOT, but TEE showed that there was
no evidence of vegetation/endocarditis.  Patient was
transitioned to levofloxacin, and did well on it, no longer
spiking fevers and with normalization of white cell count.

# AMS: Patient presented with decreased alertness on arrival
secondary to toxic ingestion and heroin use.  Patient received
narcan and was monitored carefully for withdrawal symptoms.
Patient is currently at his baseline.

# Suicidial ideation: Per communication with ED physicians,
patient intermittently endorsed suicidal ideation with possible
intentional heroin overdose. He continued to endorse these
thoughts after extubation once the patient was lucid.
Psychiatry saw the patient and sectioned him as he was a danger
to himself.  Psych agreed that he needs inpatient level of care.
 Patient is being discharged to a psychiatric facility for
further management.

# Polysubstance Abuse: Patient reports heroin and vicodin use.
Social work and psychiatry were involved.  He was monitored on
CIWA scale for benzo withdrawal, but did not show any withdrawal
symptoms.  Patient was on dilaudid PRN for pain but this was
tapered down.  Patient was agreeable to transfer to psych
facility and with coming off of dilaudid on discharge.

#. Left shoulder pain - patient says he ran his shoulder into a
doorframe prior to admission.  Plain films show no evidence of
fracture.  His pain is managed using naproxen and tylenol as
needed.

# Renal Insufficency: Patient has an unclear baseline
creatinine, but was found to have a creatinine of 2.4 on
admission.  This improved to normal ranges with IV fluids.

# Diabetes Mellitus, Type I:  It is unclear what patient was
taking at home for diabetes control.  While admitted patient was
maintained on glargin insulin 20 units qhs with a humalog
sliding scale.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 34476**] is a 47M with a PMH s/f IDDM, ?CAD, recent
MRSA/aspiration PNA with discharge from rehab 4 days ago
(completed recent courses of vancomycin, cefepime, zosyn, and
flagyl), and recent c. diff infection [**1-/2128**] s/p 14 days of
flagyl.  By report, his HCP found him somnolent at his home
today with 100/200 oxycodone tabs missing from his pill bottle.
She took him to [**Hospital3 **], where he had a blood glucose
of 1209, and a WBC count of 32.  He was given a total of 6L NS,
1g vancomycin and an insulin drip, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In our ED, he was somnolent on admission, but arousable and able
to answer simple questions, though he could not give a detailed
history.  His initial vital signs were: T 96.6, HR 101, BP
143/56, 100%RA, RR 17.  FSBS= 500s.  He was given 1.5L NS, and
started on an insulin gtt at 10u/hr.  A 400mcg fentanyl patch
was removed.  No narcan given as the patient was arousable with
good RR.  Exam was notable for a left great toe ulcer, which did
not appear infected, bilateral foot drop, and chronic neck pain.
UA was negative for any signs of infection, and showed positive
glucose and ketones.  CBC was notable for leukocytosis to
35,000.  CXR is clear.  Blood and urine cultures sent.  Lactate
is mildly elevated to 2.3  Urine tox is negative.  Serum tox was
negative.  Electrolytes showed K+ of 4.7 and a bicarb of 11 with
an anion gap of 23.

Patient is altered, but states that he has not been having any
fevers or chills, no abdominal pain, no chest pain,
palpitations, dizziness, no diarrhea or nausea/vomiting.  He
also states that he did not take any of his home oxycodone the
day of admission.  Per OSH records, the patient reports two days
of decreased PO intake, with two episodes of vomiting overnight.

Brief Hospital Course:
47 yo male with IDDM, h/o MRSA PNA, C. diff, presenting with
DKA, c. difficile infection and altered mental status in setting
of narcotic abuse and acute medical illness.
   Of note, the patient's most important medical issue at this
point is his severe opiate abuse and dependence.  An extensive
family discussion was held with reports of many instances where
the patient would try to fool caregivers in increasing the
patient's opiate dosages.  These included fashioning fake kidney
stones out of paint.  The family brought documentation that the
patient was filling several different opiate scripts at
different pharmacies and using far in excess of the prescribed
dosages.
   The patient was on a whopping dose of narcotics on his
discharge from [**Hospital **] rehab including 400 mcg of fentanyl
patches and very large ocycodone prn doses.
   The patient does not have severe organic pain that
necessitates high opiate usage.  His pain will be managed
through adjunctive pain meds.  His fentanyl patch will be weaned
completely off over the next few weeks.  Note, the patient is
not to receive prn opiates.

1. DKA - Presenting BG 1200, HCO3 11, and AG 24.  Required
insulin gtt overnight in the ICU, and then transitioned to home
subcutaneous dose.  Likely initiated by C. difficile infection.
Patient was initially covered broadly with vanc/ceftaz/flagyl.
Cdiff toxin assay, blood and urine cultures were sent.  C. diff
toxin + (though did have recent infection). All other culture
data remained negative and foot ulcers did not appear infected.
Foot ulcers were debrided by podiatry with wound care recs.
There was no evidence of osteomyelitis or deep tissue infection
per podiatry and no antibiotics were recommended for the
patient's foot ulcers, Vanc/ceftaz were d/cd and flagyl was
continued. His insulin regimen was titrated [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]
recommendations.

2. Altered mental status - per report of health care proxy,
patient complained of ""not feeling well"" 2 days prior to
admission, and gradually developed an altered mental status. He
was then found altered with 100/200 of his monthly prescription
of oxycodone gone, though his prescription was for 20mg every 2
hours, though his tox screen in our ED was negative but does not
detect all forms of opiates. In the emergency [**Apartment Address(1) **] 100mcg
patches of fentanyl were removed, which was the dose he was on
at the time he was discharged from rehab.  His mental status
improved in the ICU, but prior to transfer to the floor, patient
was noted to be agitated and complain of nausea, which was
thought to be secondary to potential narcotic withdrawal. He was
reintiated on 200mcg of fentanyl and the next day his mental
status had improved.

3.  Leukocytosis - Patient had elevated WBC to 32K upon admit,
not febrile.  He had hx of recent hospital aquired MRSA
pneumonia, treated with vancomycin, cefepime, zosyn.  CXR upon
admit was negative for new or developing infiltrate.  He also
had recent history of CDiff, was treated with 14 day course of
IV flagyl.  Also had a history of foot ulcers, which appeared
infected upon admission, which prompted coverage for
polymicrobial etiology of diabetic ulcers; vanco for MRSA
coverage, Ceftaz/Flagyl for gram negatives, anaerobes, and C.
diff.  Cultures were pending at time of transfer to floor.
Cultures noteable for +C. diff and he was continued on flagyl.
Vanc and ceftaz were d/cd.  See section above regarding podiatry
evaluation and recommendations.

3. Chronic Kidney Disease - creatinine was at baseline upon
admission.

4. Chronic pain - Patient was on huge home doses of narcotics.
The patient was taken off all PRN opiate pain meds and he was
weabed down on his fentanyl patch.
The patient's fentanyl patch should be weaned off at 25 mcg/hr
every several days.  The patient was seen by the pain service
and addictions service.  The plan is for strict weaning off of
fentanyl.  If at time of discharge from [**Hospital1 1501**] the patient is
completly off fentanyl, then he will be admitted to the [**Hospital **]
Hospital for substance abuse treatment.  If the fentanyl has not
been completly weaned off at discharge, then the patient should
go to [**Hospital1 **] for substance abuse treatment.  The pain
service saw the patient and agreed with the above plan.  The
patient was started on clonidine patch as an adjuncive pain med
along with tylenol.  If there is concern for diabetic
neuropathic pain, then the patient could also be started on
cymbalta.  the patient agreed with the above plan on several
occasions

5.  Depression/anxiety - Patient's clonazepam was discontinued
given his history of substance abuse.

6.  Anemia - has baseline low hct, thought [**2-23**] CKD, at baseline
upon admission and remained stable.

7. Benign HTN: All BP meds initially held at admission. His
toprol was reinitiated.

8. Systolic CHF: Did not appear volume overloaded. Beta-blocker
was reinitiated.

9. Nausea: Upon transfer to the floor, patient complained of
nausea and noted to have biliary emesis. KUB negative for
obstruction. Unclear if related to DKA, narcotic withdrawal,
ileus, or gastroparesis.  With conservative treatment and
aggressive PUD/GERD treatment, the patient was able to advance
his diet with improvement in his nausea.

10. Depression: Escitalopram held at admission, but restarted.
Clonazepam discontinued given significant substance abuse
history.

11. Multiple foot ulcers: Podiatry consulted. Radiographs
negative for osteo and recommended wound care.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 24 y/o F with h/o ESRD, HTN who started
peritoneal dialysis during the week of [**2141-10-8**] and presented
with a 1 day history of acute onset N/V, sharp abdominal pain on
[**2141-10-13**]. (Of note, the patient had presented to the ED on
[**10-11**] with hypotension, SBPs in the 80s off after approximately
1.5L was taken off during dialysis in the setting of taking her
PO Anti-HTNs. On [**2141-10-11**] she received 0.5L IVF, labs WNL, and
was d/c'd home).  On the day of admission on [**2141-10-13**], the
patient reported that the previous night, she was awoken from
sleep with severe, sharp abdominal pain, 6 episodes of frothy
emesis, 10+ yellowish BMs without melena or BRBRP.She was
admitted for further work- up of this abdminal pain.
.
In the ED here vitals were as follows: T: 97.0 HR: 101 BP:
240/180 RR: 17 O2sat: 100%RA.  She received Labetolol 20mg IV
and was subsequently placed on a labetolol drip.  She also
received ceftriaxone 1gm IV, Flagyl 500mg IV, Dilaudid 0.5-1mg
IV q1hr and Zofran. Her abdominal CT showed multifocal areas of
small bowel wall thickening. Her peritoneal Cell count was
negtaive for SBP. She had some signs of peritonitis and thus
surgery was consulted. Her lactate was normal.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU the patient was mentating well with
complaints of diffuse sharp abdominal pain that radiated to the
back and diarrhea.  She had no headache or visual changes.

Blood cultures: all negative

EKG ([**2141-10-13**]): Sinus rhythm. Findings are within normal limits.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2141-10-2**] there is no
significant diagnostic change.

CXR ([**2141-10-13**]): No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. No free
air under the diaphragms.

CT chest/abdomen/pelvis ([**2141-10-13**]): There is a moderate-sized
pericardial
effusion, similar in appearance from [**2141-10-13**]. The great
vessels are normal in caliber, without aneurysmal dilatation.
Evaluation of the great vessels is limited without IV contrast.

Interstitial thickening, particularly within the perihilar
regions, is
suggestive of fluid overload. There is bibasilar atelectasis
with a small
focus of consolidation in the right lower lobe (2:35) unchanged
from [**2141-10-13**], and may reflect aspiration or pneumonia. Scattered
bilateral nodules are largely stable from as far back as
[**2139-10-9**]. Specifically, there is a 5 mm nodule in the right
middle lobe (2:25), two adjacent nodules in the right lower lobe
measuring 5 mm and 2 mm (2:24), and a 4 mm pleural based nodule
within the left lower lobe. A nodular density seen adjacent and
anterior to the right main pulmonary artery (2:23) may reflect a
vessel. There is a small right pleural effusion.

Axillary lymphadenopathy, with axillary nodes measuring up to
approximately 10 mm in short axis, is seen. Ill- defined soft
tissue thickening within the hilus bilaterally may reflect hilar
lymphadenopathy, but assessment is limited without IV contrast.
A catheter is visualized within the visualized right upper
extremity, which may reflect a PICC line that terminates within
the right subclavian vein.

The esophagus is distended and filled with contrast, with marked
wall
thickening and edema throughout its entire length, a new
finding. There is a moderate- sized hiatal hernia.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There has been interval
development of a moderate amount of free intraperitoneal air,
that layers anteriorly and along the anterior abdominal wall.
Additional small clustered foci of extraluminal air is seen
adjacent to the proximal stomach and the gastroesophageal
junction, with a focus of air tracking into the fissure of
ligamentum venosum. Additionally, there appears to be air
tracking into the anterior subcutaneous tissues in the region of
the umbilicus. These findings are all new from the prior CT on
[**2141-10-13**], but free air was present on chest radiograph performed
[**2141-10-25**]. There is no obvious evidence of extravasation of oral
contrast into the peritoneum. Of note, a peritoneal dialysis
catheter is in place that could represent a route of entry of
intraperitoneal air.

The stomach, small bowel, and colon are filled with contrast,
without evidence of obstruction. Evaluation for wall thickening
is limited without IV contrast.

Limited non-contrast views of the liver demonstrates a rounded
1.6 cm x 1.2 cm hypodensity in the right lobe of the liver,
previously characterized as a hemangioma. The liver is otherwise
unremarkable. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal
glands demonstrate no gross abnormality. Both kidneys are
atrophic. Evaluation of solid organs is limited by lack of IV
contrast.

There is a peritoneal dialysis catheter, coiled within the
pelvis, unchanged.  There is a large amount of free fluid
throughout the abdomen, similar in appearance to the prior
study.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Uterus and rectum are
grossly
unremarkable. However, assessment of the rectal wall is limited
without IV contrast.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Bones are diffusely sclerotic, which may be
related to renal osteodystrophy. There is bilateral
sacroiliitis.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of a moderate amount of free
intraperitoneal air, new from [**2141-10-13**]. A peritoneal
dialysis catheter is in place and could represent the route of
entry of free intraperitoneal air. However, as foci of air is
seen in the region of the proximal stomach and GE junction in
the setting of a recent endoscopy, perforation cannot be
excluded, though no frank extravasation of contrast is
identified.
2. New dilation and wall thickening of the entire esophagus, a
nonspecific finding that could relate to infectious or
inflammatory esophagitis; clinical correlation is recommended.
Esophagus is contrast-filled possibly representing reflux.
Hiatal hernia.
3. Anasarca, with moderate-sized pericardial effusion, pulmonary
edema, and small right pleural effusion.
4. Large amount of free intra-abdominal fluid in the setting of
peritoneal dialysis. Imaging cannot exclude SBP, which should be
evaluated for clinically.
5. Focus of consolidation within the right lower lobe, could
represent
aspiration or pneumonia, but unchanged from the prior study.

Gastric Biopsies ([**2141-10-18**]): Antrum:  Corpus-type mucosa, no
diagnostic abnormalities recognized.  Jejunum:  Small intestinal
mucosa, no diagnostic abnormalities recognized.

UE Venous U/S: No evidence of DVT of the left upper extremity,
without thrombus identified within the left subclavian vein.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 24 year old woman with ESRD secondary to SLE (started
peritoneal dialysis approximately one week prior to admission),
malignant HTN, h/o SVC syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events
(on warfarin) who is presenting with persistent suprapubic/lower
abdominal pain and new onset severe epigastric pain w/ nausea
and vomiting, and hypertension.  Her hospital course was
complicated by multiple transfers between the MICU and the floor
secondary to hypertensive urgency.

# Abdominal Pain/Diarrhea: During the patient's admission, her
complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting
progressively improved although no clear source of the symptoms
was found.  Infectious causes, including viral gastroenteritis,
peritonitis or c. dif colitis, were considered.  However, during
the initial part of her admission, the patient remained afebrile
with an initial relative leukocytosis which trended to within
baseline limits.  The patient was empirically placed on IV
flagyl, but this was discontinued when stool samples were
negative for C.difficile.  Serial abdominal exams showed no
peritoneal signs. Peritoneal dialysis fluid analysis was
negative for leukocytosis without organisms on gram stain. CT of
the abdomen on [**10-13**] showed evidence of multifocal small bowel
thickening and gastric wall edema, but no acute process.  Other
etiologies of her abdomoinal pain were also considered including
mesenteric ischemia bowel secondary to SLE vasculitis, malignant
HTN, or microthrombosis and SLE enteritis.  Surgery was
consulted and felt that the patient did not have an ischemic
bowel as serial lactates were negative and serial abdominal
exams showed improvement in pain.  A heparin drip and warfarin
were started for treatment of possible microthrombotic ischemia,
although this was stopped when the patient had evidence of a
possible GI bleed.  With regards to SLE vasculitis/enteritis,
rheumatology was consulted and they did not believe her symptoms
were related to SLE.  On [**10-18**], GI performed an EGD which showed
erosion in the gastroesophageal junction yet an otherwise normal
small bowel enteroscopy to third part of the duodenum; biopsies
of stomach antrum and proximal jejunum were negative.

Approximately halfway through her hospital course, the patient
complained of severe epigastric pain in addition to her lower
abdominal pain.  Both cardiac, GI, and pulmonary etiologies were
considered for the origin of her epigastric pain.  Pericarditis
was considered, but her EKG was unchanged from prior studies and
there had been on interval increase in her pericardial effusion
since [**2141-10-13**].  Her lungs were also essentially unchanged from
[**2141-10-13**].  However, her abdominal CT on [**2141-10-26**] showed a large
amount of free intra-abdominal fluid in the setting of
peritoneal dialysis.  As a result, the patient underwent an
exploaratory laparotomy on [**2141-10-27**].  There were no major
findings: no evidence of perforation, obstruction, or infection.
 The patient tolerated the procedure well and immediately
reported that both her epigastric and suprapubic pain were gone
after the surgery.  At discharge, the patient only complained of
some mild incisional pain.

# Hypertensive urgency: The patient was initially admitted to
the MICU with a blood pressure of 240/180. Her hospital course
was complicated by extremely labile HTN and was transferred back
and forth between the MICU and the floor on three separate
occasions ([**10-19**], [**10-21**], and [**10-22**]) for identical episodes of
SBPs > 260.  Throughout all of these episodes of hypertensive
urgency, the patient remained asymptomatic from a neuro and
cardiac standpoint except for occasional headache. Her final
transfer to the floor occured [**2141-10-25**], where she remained for
the rest of her hospital course.  Multiple medication regimens
were attempted and changed throughout her hospital course.
However, her blood pressures finally stabilized when she was
placed back on her oral home regimen, which includes nifedipine,
clonidine patch, labetalol, aliskiren, and hydralazine, with a
hydralazine sliding scale for SBPs > 180.  At discharge, the
only change from her home regimen that was made was increasing
her nifedipine to 90 mg PO.

Her regimen as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4883**]:
Nifedipine SR 90 mg daily
Aliskiren 150 mg [**Hospital1 **]
Labetalol 300 mg TID
Hydralazine 75 mg TID
Clonidine patch 0.3 mg/24 hr patch qWed
When SBP>180, she then uses a hydralazine sliding scale. When
SBP>180, give 25 mg PO hydral every 30 min until SBP<150. You
can
use this for up to 2-3 hours. In between PO hydral doses, can
then also use 10 IV hydralazine.

# ESRD: The etiology of the patient's ESRD is secondary to SLE.
Her Creatinine on admission was 7.9, which was near her baseline
of 8 - 9.  During her admission, the patient underwent multiple
trials of peritoneal dialysis, but was unable to tolerate it on
a consistent basis secondary to abdominal pain.  Prior to her
exploratory laparotomy, she was scheduled to have peritoneal
dialysis four times per day over 4hrs with 2% solution at 1.2L
per PD.  After her exploratory laparotomy, surgery strongly
advised the medical team that she should not restart peritoneal
dialysis until she was at least 3 weeks out from her surgery.
Initially, the patient adamantly refused hemodialysis.  However,
over several days, she became hyperkalemic and increased
swelling was noted bilaterally in her ankles and feet.  As a
result, after a long coversation with her primary renal
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] agreed to restart hemodialysis.  A tunneled
catheter was placed in her R femoral vein on [**2141-11-1**] and she
subsequently started hemodialysis the same day, which she
tolerated well.  She underwent hemodialysis two more times prior
to discharge.  Upon discharge, her electrolytes were back to her
baseline.  She is expected to undergo hemodialysis
(Tues/[**Last Name (un) **]/SAT) as an outpatient.

# Anemia: During her admission, the patient's HCT was monitored
daily with HCT to low-mid 20's. On [**2141-10-17**], she was found to
have guaiac positive stools and her HCT was found to have
dropped to a low of 18.6.  The patient was transfused a total of
2 units of [**Date Range **] between [**2141-10-17**] and [**2141-10-18**]. Epo Alfa SC was
also given on [**2141-10-17**]. She remained hemodynamically stable. GI
consulted and EGD results were as stated above.  The patient's
HCT remained stable (hovering between 25 - 27) from [**2141-10-19**] -
[**2141-10-23**].  Between [**2141-10-23**] - [**2141-10-24**], the patient had a HCT
drop from 26 to 20 in the setting of occult positive emesis.
She received two units of [**Month/Day/Year **] and her HCT returned to 28. GI
was aware and planned to perform a non-urgent EGD on [**10-25**] or
[**10-26**] as the patient was hemodynamically stable and her HCT
returned to baseline.  However, this did not occur as the
patient went for an exploratory laparotomy on [**2141-10-27**] and her
HCt remained stable and near baseline for the remiainder of her
hospital course.

# H/O Thrombosis: The patient was initially placed on her home
dose of warfarin 2mg qd. Her INR on admission was 1.2.  She was
also started heparin drip secondary to concern for ischemic
bowel [**2-11**] microthrombotic disease.  However, this was stopped
for her EGD and after she had evidence of a GI bleed.  The
heparin drip was discontinued on [**10-22**]. The patient remained off
heparin and coumadin from [**2141-10-23**] - [**2141-10-25**] given her drop in
HCT and in preparation for a possible GI intervention. After her
surgery, her coumadin was held and she was off the heparin drip,
but her INR continued to drift up, getting as high as 2.6 on
[**2141-10-30**].  This was mostly attributed to nutritional deficiency
[**2-11**] poor PO intake, but there was concern for possible synthetic
dysfunction as well.  As a result, she was given a test dose of
vitamin K, which she responded to well (Her INR came back down
to 1.4).  As a result, her home dose of coumadin at 2 mg qday
was restarted.  At discharge, her INR was still sub- therapeutic
at 1.4.

Of note, the patient has a history of SVC syndrome and had a L
subclavian venous thrombosis.  During the last few days of her
hospital stay, the patient complained of increased tongue
swelling and her L face was noted to be slightly more swollen
than previously noted.  As a result, she underwent upper
extremity venous ultrasound on [**2141-11-2**], which showed no
evidence of a DVT within the left upper extremity and the
previously noted thrombus within the left subclavian vein was
not seen as well.

# SLE: Rheumatology was consulted several times throughout her
hospital course, but they did not think that a lupus flare was
contributing to her presentation.  Her outside rheumatologist
was also consulted.  Both parties wanted to keep the patient on
her home dose of prednisone of 4 mg qday, which was continued
throughout her entire hospital course.

# Obstructive sleep apnea: The patient was noted to have OSA
based on clinical nocturnal exam during admission. Patient
attempted 1 trial of CPAP at 2L/min for 1-2 hrs with nasal mask,
however did not tolerate as she complained of claustrophobia.
The paitent stated that she would pursue further work-up and
treatment for OSA as an outpatient. While the mask and CPAP
machine were at her bedside throughout her hospital course, the
patient rarely used it.

# Metabolic Acidosis:  The patient's bicarbonate on admission
was 13.  Her baseline is normally between 16-20. She received
150mEq NaHCO3 over 24hrs from [**Date range (1) 43500**].  During her brief
returns to the MICU, her HC03 was 18-19, which was presumed to
be her baseline at home secondary to her CRF. At discharge,
having undergone three rounds of hemodialysis, her bicarbonate
was within normal limits at 28.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection
[**3-19**] lethargy.  He was kept sedated overnight on a propofol drip.
 The morning after admission, he was awake and agitated,
thrashing and trying to get his tube out despite large doses of
propofol.  We spoke with toxicology who informed us that
although he took sustained-release morphine, he was unlikely to
worsen from a mental status standpoint if he was awake.
Therefore, he was extubated on HD#2 and did well from a
pulmonary standpoint with no further issues.

2. Cardiovascular: Mr. [**Known lastname 26699**] was noted to have T wave
inversions on tele on the evening of [**10-22**]. An ECG was obtained
that showed deep T wave inversions throughout all leads. At that
time, pt was CP free without SOB or diaphoresis. He was ruled
out for MI with negative cardiac enzymes times three. An echo
was obtained which showed a normal EF and good wall motion.
There was concern for cerebral T given ECG appearance. CT and
MRI of the head were obtained which showed no significant
abnormallity.

3. Psych- Psychiatry was consulted in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] given the pt's
overdose suicide attempt. He was started on valium and clonidine
for withdrawal. BEST saw the pt to assist in his placement in an
inpatient detox facility.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 20 year old female with h/o ESRD secondary to
SLE. She is currently on HD through a L IJ tunnelled catheter on
MWF @ [**Hospital1 1426**]. She was dialysed on the day of admission and at
the end of dialysis her  her post HD BP was 230-240s and she
also experienced a bitemporal headache with blurry vision.
Also, she described transient CP sensation for 1 minute at HD.
.
In ED she was noted to have SBP to 250s and was given
phentolamine X2, clonopine PO and patch, hydralazine with
minimal effect. A CT head showed no evidence of bleed.  A
nipride gtt was started with some effect with SBP falling
transiently to 190.
.
On arrival to MICU, pt was switched to labetalol gtt out of
concern for potential toxicity on nipride.  Labetalol was
effective initially but pt did have SBP to 230.  Pt had
witnessed, tonic clonic seizure for 30 seconds with + tongue
biting  and spontaneous resolution + post-ictal state.  Pt had
repeat head CT negative and neuro eval who found pt
neurologically intact and recommended holding on dilantin and
getting MR head with GAD in AM to r/o posterior
leukoencephalopathy
.
Pt had second seizure lasting 2-3 minutes and was given 2mg IV
ativan with good effect.  Dilantin IV 1gm load given.
Additional labs returned with phos at 1.1 so PO and IV repletion
started.

*
ECG:
Sinus tachycardia with slowing of the rate as compared to the
previous tracing
of [**2138-4-16**]. Biatrial enlargement and new T wave inversion in lead
aVL with
dissociated ST-T wave flattening in lead I.
*
Head MRI:
Abnormal T2 and FLAIR signal within both occipital and parietal
lobes in a pattern suggestive of posterior reversible
encephalopathy syndrome
*
Knee X ray:
Normal L knee.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/p 20 yo F with ESRD on HD who p/w hypertensive crisis and has
new onset seizure
.
1) Hypertensive emergency
Her blood pressure was controlled with a labetaolol drip and she
was then transitioned to po labetalol. She was also continued on
the clonidine patch. In light of her complaints of chest pain we
were reassured by her ECG and by her flat cardiac enzymes.
.
2) New onset seizure
We thought that her new onset seizures were probably due to her
severely elevated blood pressure but other diagnoses including
lupus cerbritis were also considered.
An MRI with gadolinium was obtained.  It demonstrated abnormal
T2 and FLAIR signal within both occipital and parietal lobes in
a pattern suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathy
syndrome. We consulted the rheumatology service who thought that
her presentation was more consistent with hypertensive
encephalopathy rather lupus cerebritis. She was loaded with
dilantin. With dilantin loading and control of her blood
pressure she did not have a recurrence of her seizures.
.
3) Lupus:
She was continued on her plaquenil and prednisone.
.
4) ESRD
She continued to receive regulary scheduled hemodialysis.
.
5) Knee Pain:
On the day of discharge the patient complained of L knee pain.
On physical exam she was afebrile, the knee was slightly warm
and tender to the touch without obvious effusion. An X ray of
the knee was read as normal. She had full range of motion but it
was painful but she was able to bear weight on it. She was
instructed to use tylenol prn for pain and to return o the
clinic or emergency room should she develop worsening knee pain,
fevers or chills.
.
Communicaton:
The patient and the patient's mother were extensively counselled
about the patient's disease. She demonstrated an understanding
of the importance of good medical compliance with therapy and
keeping appointments.

IMAGING:
CXR: Acute infective change in the right lower lobe with right
basal effusion superimposed on multifocal pulmonary opacities
consistent with areas of infection.

EKG: SR 94 nml axis, rSr' in V1, 1mm J point elevation in V2. No
significant change compared to [**1-17**].

ECHO ([**7-/2126**]): Global, diffuse HK; EF 35%

TTE [**2128-2-5**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild basal
inferior wall hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-8-6**],
overall biventricular systolic function has substantially
improved, but regionality of LV dysfunction is now appreciated.
The other findings are similar.

2 view CXR [**2128-2-6**]:
PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**2-6**]

HISTORY: Multifocal pneumonia. Hypoxemia.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-25**] through [**2-4**].

Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema is stable since [**2-4**]. Moderate
right and small left pleural effusion have increased. Right
middle lobe
consolidation most likely pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly
stable. Tip of
the left PIC catheter projects over the superior cavoatrial
junction.
Interval improvement in left suprahilar consolidation suggests
that this
second region of pneumonia is improving.



Brief Hospital Course:
AP: 47 yo M with IDDM, recent multifocal, MRSA pneumonia, now
with hypoxia at rehab

#. Hypoxia: The patient had a recent/resolving multifocal, MRSA
pneumonia, and his symptoms (cough, sputum production) have been
resolving, although there does appear to be a new RLL infiltrate
and he has completed > 14 days now of vanc and zosyn. He had no
crackles on exam, but there was mild bilateral ankle edema,
grossly elevated BNP, and pt has history of systolic dysfunction
which could point to heart failure as a cause of his hypoxia.
Also in favor of heart failure is the improvement he had with
diuresis at rehab prior to transfer. Finally, diabetic
gastroparesis may predispose to aspiration as well as his
impaired oropharyngeal swallow seen on recent S & S, which, with
his new RLL infiltrate and acuity of event, seems most likely
explanation.
Patient underwent IV lasix diuresis and was discharged on his
normal lasix 20 mg po qd regimen.  The patient may require
further diuresis to optimize his pulmonary status per discretion
of the physicians at [**Hospital1 **].

He was treated with cefepime (day 1 [**2-4**]), renally dosed for an
8-day course days given his likely aspiration; He was continued
on vanc(8 more days)& flagyl.

#. CAD risks: Given the patient's acute hypoxia and cardiac risk
factors such as DM and a low EF. Serial enzymes were checked to
rule out ischemia.  He was continued on ASA and a B-blocker.  A
TTE showed EF 50%, mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD, mild mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary
hypertension.

#. IDDM: He was continued on glargine 12 units at bedtime and
HISS with meals.

#. C diff: The patient was diagnosed recently with C.diff and
was continued to be treated with flagyl x14 past end of other
antibiotics.

#. Thrombocytosis: likely due to his recent, serious infection.


#. Depression: The patient was continued on his outpatient
medication regmien.

#. HTN:  Patinet's metoprolol was continued.

#. CKD, Stage 3: current Cr of 2.2 is below recent values of
[**3-25**].

#. Chronic pain syndrome: The patient continued to experience
low back pain.  He was continued on fentanyl patches, lidocaine,
neurontin per his outpatient regimen and given break through
pain control with morphine 5mg oral liquid.

#. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely secondary to CKD. He
was continued on epo (formulary exchange for darbepoetin).

#. FEN: The patient's most recent S & S recs were pills whole or
with purees, thin liquids and pureed diet and he was continued
on this regimen.

EKG [**7-25**]: Sinus tachycardia, rate 103. Since the previous
tracing of [**2183-3-31**] the heart rate is faster. Technical artifacts
are present. Minimal increase in ST-T wave abnormalities is
present

Radiology:
[**7-25**] CXR: An ET tube has been placed with tip 6.3 cm above the
carina, above the level of the clavicular heads. The tube could
be advanced approximately 3 cm to ensure proper positioning. An
NG tube traverses below the diaphragm with tip off the field of
view. The lungs are grossly clear and there is no evidence of
consolidations or edema. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged
compared to the prior exam, though this may be due to technique.
Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no
evidence of pneumothorax.

[**7-26**] Head CT w/o contrast: There is no intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no mass effect, shift of normally midline structures,
hydrocephalus, or acute vascular territorial infarct. The
density values of the brain parenchyma are normal, and the
ventricles and basal cisterns are unremarkable. Fluid secretions
within the posterior nasopharynx and oropharynx are likely
related to patient's intubated status. Visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are otherwise normally aerated.

[**7-27**] CXR: Comparison with the previous study done [**2183-7-26**]. The
lungs remain clear. The heart and mediastinal structures are
unremarkable. The left hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated. An
endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube have been removed.

Brief Hospital Course:
48 year old female with chronic pain (back, leg, foot) initially
admitted [**7-26**] to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after being found somnolent in the setting
of multiple drug ingestion (Vicodin, trazodone, Seroquel,
Neurontin).

1) Polysubstance overdose: Patient is on multiple psychiatric
meds (see admission med list), in addition to Vicodin and
neurontin. Urine tox screen was positive for amphetamines,
opiates, and benzodiazepines, and serum tox was notable for a
Tylenol level of 80. A toxicology consult was obtained and the
patient was started on N-acetylcysteine for Tylenol overdose and
a dose of charcoal. She was intubated in the emergency room and
transferred to the intensive care unit. She was extubated on
[**2183-7-26**] without difficulty. Her liver function tests remained
normal, and N-acetylcysteine was discontinued. She was
transferred to the general medical floor on [**2183-7-28**]. Psychiatry
followed the patient closely throughout her hospital stay.
Although the patient denies intentional overdose, she
acknowledges multiple recent social stressors and passive
suicidality, raising concern that this overdose represented a
suicide attempt. Psychiatry therefore recommended section 12 and
psychiatric admission.

2) Bipolar disorder: As recommended by psychiatry, all of the
patient's psychiatric medications were discontinued. Her
psychiatric medications will be re-started/titrated once she is
transferred to a psychiatric facility.

3) Hypothyroidism: The patient was continued on levothyroxine;
recent TSH wnl

4) Asthma: The patient has a chronic cough attributed to asthma.
CXR was without infiltrate. She was continued on flovent and
albuterol and was started on atrovent. She may benefit from
outpatient PFTs (last obtained in [**2178**]).

5) Anemia: At time of discharge, the patient's hematocrit was
stable. Although ferritin was low at 15, iron/TIBC were normal.
This should be monitored as an outpatient and further work-up of
occult bleeding pursued at the discretion of the patient's
primary care physician. [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] B12 and folate were normal.

6) Disposition:  The patient is medically stable for transfer to
psychiatric facility.

History of Present Illness:
36yo male w/ h/o depression, substance abuse and diabetes found
hypotensive and altered this morning by his family. Yesterday he
came home from being out and was ""like a zombie"" and vomited. He
went downstairs to his basement apartment until this morning,
when he walked up the stairs and complained of right leg pain,
difficulty voiding and difficulty hearing. He had vomit on
himself. He has had trouble voiding in the past, but a work-up
including cystoscopy was negative. He had difficulty standing,
and was found by his cousin to have a pressure of 60/40, so they
called EMS. He would not tell them what substance he had taken.
He had had a productive cough for the last 2 weeks. He had a
voluntary weight loss of 60 lbs over the last several months
through dieting and exercise. He had been working out a lot, but
they did not know of him taking supplements. He had a history of
severe depression and oxycontin abuse, and had recently been
very depressed, but had not told his [**First Name3 (LF) **] of plans for
suicide. He told them he had a 'tumor' in his groin, but that he
had it checked out by a doctor, and it was okay.
.
Found by EMS confused, pale, cool and sitting in a chair. He was
complaining of pain in his right thigh and hearing loss. Found
to be bradycardic to the 40s, hypotensive, and hypothermic with
a rectal temperature of 95.7. Blood sugar 52.
.
At [**Hospital3 **], he was initially awake enough to admit to
heroin abuse and that he took a bunch of pills yesterday, though
altered. Labs were notable for WBC 18.3 with 17% bands, CK
[**Numeric Identifier 2686**], Lactate 6.9, AST 2399, ALT 1720, K 7.4, Cr 4.19, Acetamin
neg, Salic 7.2 (nml), tox + for cocaine, opiates, benzos and
amphetamines. Got narcan, insulin, D50 and bicarb. He had two
PIV's and an IO placed. He got IV fluids, ceftriaxone and
vancomycin. CXR showed diffuse bilateral opacities. Intubated
prior to transfer.
.
On arrival to our ED, initial vitals were  98.0 rectal, 86,
103/40, 16, 100%. Initial gas 7.18, 45, 235, 18. I/O not
working, so it was removed. Hypotensive to 72/48. Patient had a
R IJ CVL placed and was started on Levophed. Bedside ultrasound
showed poor cardiac squeeze, but no pericardial effusion and a
negative FAST. WBC count 14 with 9% bands. Given Zosyn and IV
fluids. K+ down to 5.3, lactate 4.6. Serum tox negative, urine
tox positive for cocaine and opiates, but negative for benzos
and amphetamines. Lipase 165. LFTs trending up, so patient
started empirically on NAC. Vital signs prior to transfer were
135/58 (on 0.15 Levophed), 90, sat 100% on vent.
.
On the floor, intubated and sedated. Unable to give further ROS.
Grimaces with palpation of his legs.

.
Echocardiogram: IMPRESSION: Vigorous biventricular systolic
function (LVEF >55%). No significant valvular disease seen.
Normal estimated intracardiac filling pressures with high
cardiac output.
.
CT head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. Fluid within
the sinuses as above, most likely due to intubation.
.
Renal ultrasound: IMPRESSION: No evidence of renal obstruction.

Brief Hospital Course:
36yo male w/ h/o substance abuse and depression, found altered,
hypothermic and hypotensive.  After his ICU admission he was
transferred to the floor in stable condition although his
creatinine continued to rise.  After that improved with no
intervention other than diuresis, he was discharged in stable
condition to a shelter for help with his polysubstance
dependency issues.
.
# Altered mental status: Most likely secondary to an ingestion.
Patient later admitted to heroin ingestion. Percocet and
Oxycontin bottles found in his room. Urine tox positive for
opiates (on a screen that does not detect oxycodone) and
cocaine. Other possibilities would be sepsis, post-ictal phase,
toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, hepatic or renal encephalopathy.
Toxicology was consulted and thought this could be due to
tylenol overdose or cocaine in setting of elvated LFTs, although
OSH tylenol was negative. Patient started on NAC protocol and
completed with resolution of LFTs. Patient mental status cleared
by the time patient was tranferred to the floor. Patient states
his only ingestion leading up to admission was his home vicodin,
heroin (inhaled) and clonipin. Patient MS continued to improve
but in setting of worsening renal failure, patient carefully
monitered for uremic encephalopathy.  On the floor the patients
mental status returned to [**Location 213**], labs improved and the patient
was discharged with a normal mental status.
.
# Hypotension/hypothermia: Differential originally included drug
overdose, hypovolemia and overwhelming infection. Patient had no
source of infection as CXR and lung exam clear, UA negative, no
abdominal pain therefore antbiotics were withheld. Per
toxicology, differential of ingestion in setting of initial
bradycardia includes calcium channel blockers, beta blockers and
digoxin. Patient had no change in blood sugars and his digoxin
level was negative. Patient was continued on IVF wide open,
especially in setting of rhabdo. Patient was eventually weaned
from pressors that were started in the MICU. Once patient had
stable BP for 24hrs, patient was transferred to the floor.
Patient continued to have stable blood pressures for the rest of
his admission.
.
# Transaminitis: Most likely due such as Tylenol vs shock liver.
Started on N-Acetylcysteine in ED, received full course. Believe
that LFTs could have been elevated with acute tylenol overdose
but hypoperfusion is more likely especially as patient has signs
of hypoperfusion with his kidneys with evidence of ATN. LFTs
continue to downtrend. INR continues to downtrend as well. At
time of [**Location **] his LFTs had normalized, his INR was baseline
and he did not require further checks of his LFTs.
.
# Rhabdomyolysis: Appears to be localized primarily to his lower
extremities. Could be cocaine, an exercise supplement, or
prolonged period down. Patient started on aggressive fluid
resuscitation for his first few days in the MICU. Patient
continued to have downtrending CK with eventual DC of fluids
especially in the setting of worsening renal failure.
.
# Acute renal failure: Likely a combination of hypovolemia
(hypoperfusion) and rhabdomyolysis. Patient aggressively fluid
resuscitated as above, with down trending CK. Urinalysis showed
evidence of muddy brown casts consistent with ATN, most likely
due to hypoperfusion. Renal ultrasound was negative for any
other acute process. Patient creatinine continued to trend up,
as well as BUN. Patient was hypervolemic on examination and per
renal given large dose lasix to try to improve kidney function.
Patient was monitered for signs of uremic encephalopathy.
Patient also had increasing anion gap most likely due to uremia.
Patient was followed by nephrology and did not require any HD as
he reached plateau and then began having downtrending creatinine
which was siginificantly improved at the time of disposition.
Urine output remained excellent
.
# Elevated lipase: Likely from hypotension, never c/o abdominal
pain. Lipase trended down with fluid resuscitation.
.
# Elevated troponin: Likely from overall hypoperfusion. EKG was
reassuring. Enzymes were trended and came down without EKG
changes.
.
# Depression/substance abuse: Patient has hx of severe
depression. It was unclear if patient had suicide attempt. Per
family, patient's depression has been getting more severe and in
turn his drug abuse more frequent. Social work was involved in
patient's care early. Once patient's sensorium cleared, patient
evaluated by psych who thought the patient was stable from a
psychiatric point of view.  He will be discharged to a shelter
where he can continue his rehabilitation.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 20 year old female with a past medical history
significant for systemic lupus erythematosis who woke on day of
admission with blurry vision. The patient was initially
diagnosed at age 16 when her fingers swelled up and 6 months
later a kidney biopsy confirmed the lupus nephritis. She's been
medically managed on prednisone and had a trial of cytoxan which
she did not tolerate due to nausea and vomitting. Her
hypertension has been controlled with enalopril, atenolol, and
nifedipine until about 7 days prior to admission when she ran
out of medication and for that reason has been non-adherent.

On the day of admission, Ms. [**Known lastname **] called 911 and en route to
this facility developed an intense headache, localizing to the
right temporal region. In the ambulance she was discovered to
have a systolic blood pressure of about 300. Upon arrival at the
ED, she developed chest pain and shortness of breath. Morphine,
labetelol 20 IV, atenolol 50 PO, and enalapril 20 PO were
administered. She was then started on a nifedipine drip. Later,
the nifedipine was weaned for a concern of renal insufficiency
and a NTG drip was started at which point her systolic blood
pressure decreased to 180. A head CT was obtained which was
negative but she did have papilledema per the ED notes. An EKG
showed strain. The patient was admitted to the MICU overnight.
Of note, it was discovered that her creatnine was up to 5 from a
baseline of 1.5.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 20 year old woman with hypertensive emergency,
lupus nephritis, and TTP vs. malignant hypertension inducing
thrombocytopenia.

HTN: Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a hypertensive emergency, as evidenced by EKG
changes, papilledema, and head CT changes. This was thought
likely secondary to a lupus flare, ARF and poor medication
compliance. She was started back on metoprolol and nifedipine,
but her ACE I was held for the renal failure. The metoprolol was
changed to toprol xl and a clonidine patch were added for better
control and a simplified regimen as there was concern for
patient compliance. Titration of these medications on the
medical floor and addition of hydralazine did not result in
adequate BP control as the patient had several systolic blood
pressure readings in the 250s. She was then transferred to the
intensive care unit for uncontrolled BP accompanied by head
ache. Once there, she received IV antihypertensives and HD was
initiated. Several lbs were taken off, facilitating BP control
with oral medications. She was transferred back to the medical
floor and stabilized on a regimen of clonidine patch Qweek, TID
labetolol, and QD lisinopril.

Rheum: Ms. [**Known lastname **] has SLE with discoid rash and ARF. She was
started on a prednisone burst with calcium supplementation. She
was also started on plaquanil for 1-2 months for her discoid
rash. She will be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic, who will
arrange for her to see an ophthalmologist. Of note, her
complement levels were low, her DS DNA was positive and her
anti-cardiolipin IgG and IgM were within normal limits.

Renal: Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with acute on chronic renal
insufficiency. Her rise in creatinine was dramatic, from
baseline of 1.2 in [**Month (only) 958**] to 5.2 at presentation. This was
thought to be multifactorial, from both HTN and an exacerbation
of SLE. Her ACE inhibitor was initially held, and her creatinine
continued to worsen. Of note, her UA remained somewhat bland,
without acanthocytes. Her blood pressure remained difficult to
control, requiring another trip to the MICU for administration
of IV antihypertensives. It was decided that some of this was
attributed to volume overload, so HD was initiated. A tunnel
line was placed and the patient tolerated the procedure and the
HD well. It was thought that the HD would be temporary but that
the patient would eventually progress to ESRD in the near
future. She was also started on mycophenolate mofetil in the
hopes of slowing her progression to ESRD and giving her a few
months before having to start HD as more permanent renal
replacement. She was discharged with instructions to come for HD
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

Heme: Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with ARF, thrombocytopenia, anemia,
and leukopenia. Her haptoglobin was low and LDH was high,
concerning for hemolysis. DIC was considered unlikely since her
coagulation studies were within normal limits but [**Doctor First Name **], TTP/HUS
were considered a possibility. A peripheral smear showed
schistocytes, so the Heme service was consulted, however this
presentation could also be secondary to a malignant hypertension
inducing shearing of erythrocytes and platelets. Her ARF could
be attributed to her hypertension as well. Given the concern for
TTP, the heme service initiated plasmapheresis with the
assistance of the blood bank. The patient had 7 plasmapheresis
treatments, one of which was complicated by symptomatic
hypocalcemia evidenced by abdominal pain. She was plasmapheresed
until her platelets reached 150. Of note, her ADAMST 13 studies
were not consistent with TTP, although these studies are still
investigational. She was also started on folate and iron for her
anemia.

GI: Ms. [**Known lastname **] had one episode of hematemesis during
plasmapheresis. This was comprised of approximately 5 cc of
clots of blood concurrently with a hematocrit drop. With this
concern for GIB, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred back to the MICU
where an EGD showed diffuse linear erythema of the mucosa with
no bleeding in the stomach body. These findings were compatible
with mild gastritis but did not account for the HCT drop. She
was started on a PPI and asked to avoid NSAIDs.

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 24 year old woman with SLE, CKD V, and multiple
admissions for labile hypertension who presented to the ED
complaining of about a weeks?????? worth of right leg pain.  The pain
is worst when she tried to bear weight on the leg, or when she
uses it to roll over or adjust her position in bed.  The pain
begins in her buttock and travels down the posterior thigh and
calf but stops before reaching the ankle.  It occasionally feels
like it is coming from her low back.  She denies any
parasthesias or weakness in the leg, and she denies any numbness
in her foot or groin.  She denies any fevers or incontinence.
The pain was unrelieved by Vicodin that she had at home, so she
scheduled an urgent visit with her nephrologist yesterday
[**2141-9-4**].  At her nephrologist??????s office, she was hypertensive to
250/145 and so she was referred to the ED.  She ended up leaving
the ED against medical advice yesterday, but returned today
because of persistent leg pain.  She reports that she took all
of her morning and noon BP meds.



She denies any fevers, headaches, visual changes, nausea (prior
to coming to the ED), or leg weakness.



Upon arrival to the ED today, she was afebrile, BP 237/146, HR
97, RR 16, Sat 100% on room air.  She received a total of 90 mg
of IV labetalol and nitropaste, and was eventually put on a
labetalol drip for her hypertension.  With these interventions,
her SBP dropped to the 180s, but she reported feeling nauseous
and so the drip was discontinued.  She was also given 4 mg of IV
morphine and 1 mg of IV hydromorphone for her leg pain with
decent relief.  Due to a urinalysis suggestive of infection, she
was given one tablet of DS TMP/SMX.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 24 year old woman with SLE, CKD V, and multiple
admissions for labile hypertension who presented to the ED
complaining of about a weeks?????? worth of right leg pain. She was
initially admitted to the MICU for hypertensive urgency and then
transfered to the floor after a day.

# Hypertensive urgency: had been on labetalol drip in the ED,
but this was stopped due to nausea (presumed that her BP was
coming down too fast).  She was started on her home meds and
tolerated these fairly well.  Transferred to the floor and noted
to have SPBs in the 90s.  She required 1L IVF bolus since her
baseline SBP is thought to run in the 130-170 range.  She also
had transient dizziness during this episode.  BP meds were held
and later that night her SBP was in the 220s.  BP meds
restarted.  She remained stable thereafter with SBPs in the
130-170s.  We opted to discharge her on her home regimen
(without decreasing doses) since she is more often having issues
with elevated blood pressures.
.
# Right leg pain: no evidence of avascular necrosis or fracture
on plain film. MRI and plain films were ordered and showed no
acute pathology.  The pain was in the distribution of her right
hamstring and was worsened when it was stretched thus suggesting
a muscle injury.  CK was normal.  Pain was treated with dilaudid
initially.  On day of discharge, she was able to ambulate
without gait abnormality or pain.  PT saw her and rec outpt PT
followup.
.
# CKD V: PD catheter placement in place. Pt was tried on PD on a
number of occasions but did not tolerate it [**2-11**] pain.  KUB
confirmed tip in place.  Cx of peritoneal fluid not suggestive
of peritonitis.  K remained mildly elevated.  Hyperpara treated
with sevelamer (although patient refused) then tums.  Pt will
reconsider PD as outpatient.
.
# Anemia: chronic.  Received 2u pRBC while inhouse for Hct in
the 18-19 range.  Had appropriate response.  Not on Epo given
hypertension
.
# ID: Rx with cipro for ? UTI although urine cx neg.  Also had
temp to 101 on evening prior to discharge.  No clear source.  PD
fluid cultured and NGTD.  Pt remainded HD stable on day of
discharge.
.
# Prior SVC thrombus. Continued warfarin with appropriate INR
checks.  INR elevated on day of discharge.  Rec holding coumadin
for 2d
.
# Systemic lupus erythematosus: cont home prednisone dose

Discharge Condition:
ambulating without difficulty.  tolerating oral diet.  afebrile
and SBP in the 130-150 range.


Discharge Instructions:
You came in with right leg pain and poorly controlled
hypertension.  Your blood pressure was controlled initially with
IV medications then your home medications.  Since your blood
pressure was occasionally low, we recommend that you hold your
labetalol if you are feeling lightheaded or have dizziness or
have blood pressure less than 110/60.

In terms of your leg pain, we performed xrays, ultrasound, and
MRI without finding a cause.  We suspect a hamstring injury
given its location.  Please take pain medications if needed.  We
recommend followup with physical therapy.

You also had a fever which is suggestive of infection.  We
treated you with cipro in case you had a UTI.  Otherwise, your
cultures were unrevealing.

We attempted peritoneal dialysis but this was unsuccessful.
Please followup with your nephrologist.

Please return to the ED if you experience headache, chest pain,
shortness of breath, high fevers, or worsening leg pain.

Please hold your coumadin for two days then restart as per
previously written.  Please take lactulose for constipation.

Brief Hospital Course:
53 yo female with history of severe COPD, Hep C, IVDU, and
recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2186-4-29**] for COPD was
re-admitted from the ED on [**2186-4-30**] with headache, altered mental
status, and blurred vision, now with MRI suggesting PRES related
to Methylprednisolone-induced HTN, similar to prior episode.

1) PRLES: Posterior Reversible Leucoencephalopathy Syndrome
Patient had initially been admitted to the MICU service where
concern was for infectious encephalitis vs. meningitis. LP was
performed with Protein 158, Glucose 94, 4 WBC, 63 RBC in tube 4.

MRI showed [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 4746**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 46886**]-occipital lobes, cerebellum, r. thalamus,
right caudate, pons, right frontal subcort [**Male First Name (un) 4746**]. No DWI
restriction. Third vent and 4th vent larger compared. There was
evidence for descending cerebellar tonsillar herniation with
peri mesencephalic effacement. Patient was started on Mannitol
and Neurosurgery placed EVD.
In the ICU pt demonstrated widely labile BP's and tachycardia.
This was thought secondary to opiate withdrawal (on methadone).
Methadone was restarted and pt became hypotensive to SBP's 90's
requiring brief period on neosynephrine. The pt was quickly
weaned and extubated without event. Her neurologic exam improved
markedly with only persistent hyperreflexia and upgoing toes.
Mannitol was discontinued [**5-5**] and her EVD was removed [**5-7**]
(initially it was clamped and ICP briefly went up to 25-27, so
it was reopened at 20 cm H20, but she tolerated repeat clamping
trial [**5-6**]) and she remained neurologically intact. She will
need a scalp stitch removed 5 days from [**5-7**] by PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] pharmacologic action of the corticosteroids may have been
prolonged in the setting of the patient's Hep C infection,
though LFT's were only mildly elevated.
She was started on Keppra given her history of seizure during
her prior episode and she should [**Last Name (un) 7387**] on 500 [**Hospital1 **] until f/u in
neuro clinic.

2) Right ICA aneurysm-
Aneurysm at the junction of the cavernous and supraclinoid
portions of the right internal carotid artery measures 6 x 4 mm
on axial views with MRI. This should be followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
in neurosurgery.

3) COPD-
Home O2 dependent. 2L at rest. 4L with activity. On CPAP at
night. Prednisone was held given probable etiology for
hypertensive crisis. She was restarted on home advair, spiriva,
albuterol nebs, atrovent nebs.
Resp status improved and she came off O2 and CPAP which she is
normally on at home. We have encouraged her to continue to
abstain from tobacco (this may be made more difficult in the
context of a partner who smokes). She passed PT evaluation of
stairs without O2 desaturation.

4) Opioid [**Name (NI) 46887**]
Pt was on 60 mg of Methadone at home but this was decreased to
40mg daily in the ICU due to blood pressure issues, and she
tolerated that dose well with no symptoms of withdrawal so we
have discharged her on that diminished dose after discussion
with her.

History of Present Illness:
58-year-old lady with HCV cirrhosis complicated by recurrent
ascites, status post multiple large volume paracentesis, bipolar
disorder, encephalopathy, and chronic pain, recently evaluated
by hospice by outpatient consult who was found unresponsive the
night before admission at 10pm by family.  She was last seen at
her baseline at home around 8pm that night by daughter's
boyfriend.   She was given 6mg of narcan by EMS, became agitated
but did not wake up.  She was taken to an OSH where she was
intubated and head CT was negative.  She was also note to have
hematuria and blistering of her legs.
.
Daughter notes that patient recently was told by Hepatologist
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] that she was not a transplant candidate.  She obtained
a hospice consult on Saturday, but daughter did not find out
about hospice consult until Tuesday. She was given methadone for
abdominal pain and xanax to take as needed. Family found no
liquid methodone remaining and 26/100 pills of missing
methadone; daughter feels she may have accidentally overdosed on
medication because she was unsure of how to take medications.
Son noticed that she was intermittently somnolent on Tuesday
from methadone, mentioned it to Hospice nurse who encouraged
patient to continue with medications.  Daughter feels that
patient only agreed to Hospice consult to get pain medications
for abdominal pain.  Patient missed her weekly outpatient
paracentesis appointment on Monday and was noted to build
increased lower extremity edema and form bullae in lower
extremities.
.
In the ED, she was initially noted to be [**Age over 90 **]F. Propofol was
turned off but she was not noted to follow commands; she was
noted to move her feet but not her upper extremities.  EKG
showed QTc prologation.  Vitals and Vent settings prior to
transfer were as follows: BP123/52 HR113 , Vt 450cc  RR 18
(overbreathing at 30) PEEP 5 Fio2 40%.  No ABG done in ED.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 year old woman with ESLD secondary to HCV cirrhosis, seizure
disorder, bipolar disorder, transferred from OSH intubated with
altered mental status after being found down at home.

On presentation to MICU, patient was not responsive to noxious
stimuli, despite no sedative medications.  Altered mental status
was multifactorial, secondary to narcotic overdose and sepsis of
unknown source.  Patient had been recently started on Hospice,
given methadone and liquid morphine to self-titrate for pain
control.  Family noted that she had become increasingly
somnolent over the previous few days and later found a
significant amount of the narcotics missing from bottles.
Patient was felt to have overdosed on narcotics, as she did have
some mild response to narcan by EMS.  Additionally, she was
thought to be septic because her WBC was elevated past her
baseline, and she presented with tachypenea, tachycardia,
hypothermia, and lactic acidosis.  She was started initially on
ceftriaxone for empiric treatment of presumed SBP, though no
ascites noted on exam.  Antibiotics were quickly broadened
further to Vancomycin and Zosyn, as patient's blood pressures
started slowly trending downwards and lactic acidosis worsened.
CXR was clear on presentation and UA was negative for infection.


Upon discussion with patient's hepatologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**], it was
discovered that she had signed DNR/DNI papers with Hospice nurse
earlier in the week and had agreed to comfort measures.  Her son
had been present for this meeting but had requested intubation
at OSH; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] had been present over telephone conference for
the meeting as well and confirmed comfort measures.

Family meeting was held in the MICU to discuss patient's
prognosis and wishes, and family agreed to withdraw care and
keep comfort measures. They made the decision to extubate her
the evening of [**1-11**].  Patient passed the next morning with
family at her bedside.

Pertinent Results:
MRI Right Hip ([**9-18**]): There is no signal abnormality on the
fluid-sensitive
sequences in the proximal femur, acetabulum, or other osseous
structure. On T1- weighted images, there is a focal rounded
region within the right femoral head measuring approximately 9
mm in a subchondral location, which is nonspecific but may
represent an unusual focus of red marrow. No sclerosis is seen
on the corresponding plain films. There is a small right hip
joint effusion and a small amount of fluid in the left hip joint
as well, at the upper limits of normal. There is no soft tissue
abnormality, no muscular edema, and no fluid collections.
IMPRESSION: 1. Small right hip joint effusion. 2. No bone marrow
edema in the proximal femurs or the pelvis. 3. Nonspecific small
focus of low signal on T1-weighted images in the right femoral
head is nonspecific but may represent an unusual focus of red
marrow.

TTE ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF 80%). A mild (18 mmHg) mid-cavitary gradient is
identified. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. The
increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac
output. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no
systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
hyperdynamic systolic function and mild mid-cavitary gradient.
Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Findings consistent with hyperrtophic cardiomyopathy.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-8-26**],
pulmonary hypertension has developed (also present on the study
from [**2140-5-20**]). Pericardial effusion is also new.

V/Q scan ([**9-21**]): Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol
in 8 views demonstrate no focal defects with improved
ventilation to the posterior right basal segment.  Perfusion
images in the same 8 views show improved perfusion to the
posterior right basal segement with a persistent small defect
but no new findings.
Chest x-ray shows cardiomgealy and left basilar atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: Improved V/Q scan from [**9-/2139**] with no findings to
suggest acute pulmonary embolism.

B/L upper ext U/S ([**9-21**]): Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] of
the
right and left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial,
basilic and cephalic veins were performed. There is nonocclusive
focal thrombus seen in the left subclavian vein, where the vein
is not fully compressible. Flow is seen in the region,
indicating that the thrombus is nonocclusive. Elsewhere, normal
flow, augmentation, compressibility were appropriate and
waveforms are demonstrated.
IMPRESSION:
1. Focal nonocclusive thrombus in the left subclavian vein.
2. Otherwise, patent upper extremity veins as described.

Brief Hospital Course:
24 yo with h/o of Lupus, HTN, and lupus nephropathy started on
peitoneal dialysis during this admissionwho was admitted
initially for R hip pain. Patient was on the floor on [**9-20**],
given morphine for the hip pain.  She then had an episode of
hypotension and unresponsiveness and transferred to the MICU for
closer monitoring. The patient got 2L IVFs and narcan and
improved, in fact, found to be hypertensive upon arrival to
MICU.
.
MICU Course: On [**9-20**], the patient triggered for hypotension
(82/45), hypothermia (92.9) and altered mental status with
difficult arousability in setting of recent blood transfusion.
Concern was for sepsis, autonomic seizure, transfusion reaction,
pulmonary embolus and/or narcosis.  Mental status cleared
somewhat with narcan. Renal c/s felt episode likely [**2-11**]
accumulation of morphine active metabolites. V/Q scan
demonstrated improvement since prior study. Patient's home
prednisone dose was increased from 5 to 15mg with thought that
patient may be stressed in setting of acute illness. She was
febrile on [**9-21**] and resultingly started in vancomycin,
aztreonam, and levofloxacin. PD fluid was not c/w SBP. CXR was
clear. Urine culture and blood cultures are pending. Patient's
BP was in the 110s so hydralazine was stopped. Her other BP meds
were otherwise continued.  Plan was/is to follow renal recs for
PD. If, in 24-48 hours (once cultures have had 48-72 hours to
grow) no source has been located, would d/c antibiotics except
for levofloxacin.  Would continue levoflox for total 5 day
course for pneumonia possibly ? aspiration pneumonitis during
episode of altered mental status.  If patient has leg pain
again, may consider neurogenic source such a piriformis syndrome
as suggested by neurology. Would add neurontin 100mg TID with
room to titrate up to 300mg TID. Neuro also recommended PT with
TENS unit and referral to pain clinic although patient's pain is
currently absent.
.
FYI **** per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] --- Because of ? increase in
cardiomegaly on CXR, she got an echo yesterday.  In addition to
her known HOCM, this showed (1) a small pericardial effusion,
and (2) pulmonary hypertension with an estimated tricuspid
gradient of 50 mm Hg. They probably need to be followed up over
time (particularly the pulmonary hypertension).  We did
evaluated the PHTN with a VQ scan which was unremarkable, making
chronic thromboembolic disease much lower on the differential.
It would be good if we could arrange a PULMONARY CLINIC FOLLOW
UP for Ms. [**Known lastname **] after discharge with either [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] or [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].****

.
She underwent CT head, and V/Q scan which were unremarkable.
Her steroid dose was increased to 15mg given concern for need
for stress dose steroids. After transfer from the MICU, her
steroids were dropped back to 5mg, her home dose with the
approval of [**Last Name (un) **].
.
Her hypotensive episode was thought to be due to a delayed
clearing of the morphine due to her renal failure.  Her
hydralazine was discontinued.  On day 2 of her MICU stay, she
developed a fever to 102.  She was pan-cultured (blood, urine,
peritoneal dialysate) without obvious source of infection.
Broad spectrum abx were started (vanco, cipro, aztreonam (pcn
allergy)) empirically.  There was question of retrocardiac
opacity on CXR, though not clear. Rheum consult obtained given
hip discomfort, who felt septic joint unlikely.  Neurology
consult obtained who felt autonomic seizure unlikely.
.
Pt initiated peritoneal dialysis.  In this setting she has been
having some nausea, which has made taking her home labetalol
difficult, resulting in some rising BPs.  She is called out to
medical service for ongoing management and workup of fever,
nausea, and hypertension.  Her hip pain has resolved completely
without further intervention.
.
Floor course:
Fever: Spike fever in MICU to 102. Started on Levoquin,
Aztreonam, and Vanc. Source unclear at this point, but CXR with
question of retrocardiac opacity. There is a possibility of
aspiration pneumonitis. Other etiologies include peritoneal
fluid (PD cath), urine, and blood (though patient does not have
any indwelling lines). Hip, due to small effusion, could be
septic arthritis but no pain with movement on exam makes this
less likely. Peritoneal dialysis cultures negative so far.
Continued levo/vanco/aztreonam for 2 days empirically. Then
d/ced the Abx as no infectious etiologies were found. Steroids
back to home dosage. BCx, UCx (final neg), Peritoneal cultures
negative at discharge.
.
# Labile blood pressure: h/o of difficult to control BP with
episodes of hypertensive emergency in the past. Normal SBP runs
in 170s. Having nausea in setting of new PD, no evidence of
intracranial bleeding on clinical exam, though INR had been
supratherapeutic so remains in differential, though not
bradycardic. Continue home BP meds :Labetalol 900 mg PO TID but
difficult for patient to tolerate due to nausea, Aliskiren *NF*
150 mg Oral [**Hospital1 **], NIFEdipine CR 60 mg PO DAILY, clonidine patch,
hydralazine given hypertensive in setting of nausa.
.
# Right leg/hip pain: no evidence of avascular necrosis or
fracture on MRI though there is a small effusion. Pain resolved
without intervention. Continued to monitor
and would avoid narcotics, restart slowly if pain resumes.
Physical therapy to follow as an outpatient. [**Last Name (un) 18183**] followed.
Please see consult note.
.
# Hyperkalemia: Chronic issue. Patient takes kayexalate
intermittently per her report (last dose [**Last Name (un) 766**]). Monitored K
but patient did not need it on floor.

# CKD V: Renal following. Did well with PD on [**9-22**] but did
report some nause and cramping. She was not tolerating all 1.5L
in exchanges on discharge.

# Anemia: Hct stable around 20. S/p 1 U PRBCs in MICU with Hct
20.1 to 21.9. Likely due to chronic hemolysis consistent with
SLE>

#. Prior SVC thrombus: Physical exam with L arm swelling
consistent with this. No flow limitations. INR 3.5 on ICU
admission. Held warfarin but restarted home 2mg daily the day
before discharge.

# Systemic lupus erythematosus: Home prednisone dose 5mg.
Currently on 15mg in setting of acute illness (day 2).

# General care: FEN: low sodium, renal diet; treatment of
hyperkalemia as above, replete other lytes prn, PD initiated,
Proph: INR therapeutic, no indication for PPI, kayexalate as
needed for hyperkalemia and lactulose prn as per home regimen.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with high blood pressure and
right leg/hip pain. We gave you pain medications and blood
pressure lowering medications. Your blood pressure then dropped
which was caused by the pain medication, and you were
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit(ICU) where you recovered
quickly. During your stay in the ICU, you developed a fever and
were started on antibiotics. However, the cultures that were
obtained were negative, and we discontinued the Antibiotics.
During your hospitalization, your blood pressure normalized on
your home regimen, and your right leg/hip pain resolved. You had
an MRI of your hip done, which did not show an acute infection.
You were seen by the kidney doctors and they recommended
starting peritoneal dialysis. You were also given some blood for
your anemia.

Please follow up with the Peritoneal Dialysis nurse at the
scheduled day/time. Please make an appointment to meet with your
PCP in the next couple of weeks.

Your Hip pain may benefit from physical therapy or outpatient
anesthetic joint injection.  Please discuss these options with
your rheumatologist.

CLINICAL ATTENDING:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 44800**]
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 39-year-old
female who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] status post
an overdose.  The patient, at 4 PM, on [**2140-10-23**], apparently
antidepressants, Tylenol, Neurontin, Seroquel, and Paxil in
unknown quantities, as well as inhaled cocaine.  There is
also question of possible intake of rubbing alcohol as two
bottles were found near the patient.  The patient was brought
to [**Hospital3 **] via ambulance.  When she arrived at the
hospital, vital signs were pulse of 80, blood pressure
120/80, respiratory rate 18, pulse oximetry 100%.  However,
treated with 2 mg Ativan, 1 mg Narcan, 12 grams
acetylcysteine bicarbonate, 1 mg Atropine, as well as
activated charcoal.  EKG at this time showed a QRS complex
equal to 0.106.  At this point, she was started on a
bicarbonate drip.  QTC was 0.45.  The patient was then
intubated secondary to CNS depression.  Post intubation, the
systolic blood pressure dropped to the 60s.  The patient was
then started on a dopamine drip.  The patient also had a head
CT, which was negative.  Further laboratory data revealed an
arterial blood gas with a pH of 7.29, pCO2 15, pAO2 65.
Bicarbonate at this time was 18.  The patient was found to
have an anion gap of 23.  Urine toxicology screen was
positive for cocaine and tricyclics, however, negative for
alcohol.  Tylenol level at 5 PM, which was approximately two
to three hours after ingestion was 103.8.  At this time the
liver function tests, as well as the PT/INR and glucose were
all within normal limits.  At this point, the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency
Department.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency department, here, the patient
was found to have a pulse of 80, blood pressure of 85/33.
She was treated with three ampules of bicarbonate that were
pushed sequentially without any change in the QRS interval
after an EKG had shown a wide QRS complex at 0.116.  Chest
x-ray at this time was negative.  The patient had one episode
of emesis of black charcoal with a question of aspiration, as
well as one large bowel movement incontinence.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Per patient's husband, medical history
was unknown aside from a history of hypertension, as well as
history of depression.  The husband has no prior history of
suicide attempts.  She has been in multiple detoxification
facilities in the past.

MEDICATIONS:  The patient is unable to answer questions about
her home regimen and medications.  In addition, he husband is
unaware of her home regimen of medications.  Clearly, the
patient did have access to Neurontin, Seroquel, and Paxil.

(Per patient history, obtained later in the hospitalization,
the patient is on Metoprolol and Vasotec for hypertension.
She also admits to stopping the Paxil approximately two weeks
prior to admission).

ALLERGIES:  The patient reportedly has no known drug
allergies.  However, one sheet from the outside hospital
medical record does note an ALLERGY to CLEOMYCIN.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and lives with her
husband, however, reportedly, she has been having issues with
him, which are unclear at the time of admission.  She does
have a history of polysubstance abuse including cocaine and
alcohol.  The patient has recently quit her job and she is
unemployed.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown secondary to patient unable to
answer questions and husband not knowing any further
information regarding the family history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
Temperature 96.4, pulse 89, blood pressure 101/42 on a
dopamine drip at 10 and respiratory rate 14 on control
ventilation.  Vent settings at that time included
assist-control ventilation with tidal volume 600, respiratory
rate 20, FIO2 of 60% with PEEP of 5.  GENERAL:  The patient
is intubated, sedated, and unresponsive.  HEENT:  Examination
revealed pupils, which are 5 mm and sluggishly reactive and
equal.  Moist mucous membranes.  HEAD:  Normocephalic,
atraumatic.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Normal S1 and S2, 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border, regular

sounds, soft, nondistended, liver edge palpable 4 cm below
the right costal margin.  EXTREMITIES:  2+ dorsalis pedis
pulses bilaterally, no edema, no cyanosis, axillary sweat
present.  NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient is unresponsive,
sedated.  SKIN:  Warm, dry, not flush.

LABORATORY DATA:  Data revealed the following:  Arterial
blood gases pH 7.44, pCO2 37, PO2 226 on FIO2 of 60%.  White

Urinalysis revealed specific gravity of 1.002, negative
nitrite, negative leukocyte esterase, no glucose, no ketones,
and 30 protein.  Serum toxicology screen reveals Tylenol
level of 123, aspirin level of 12, which is subtherapeutic,
no tricyclic antidepressants, no alcohol, no barbiturates,
and no benzodiazepines.  Urine toxicology screen is positive
for cocaine, but negative for benzodiazepines, barbiturates,
opiates, amphetamines, and methadone.

EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, rate of 90, and normal axis.  No S
waves in leads 1, AVL, no large R waves in leads AVR, QRS
complex 116.  T-wave inversions V1 to V4, with question of
biphasic T waves.

Chest x-ray:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No evidence
of aspiration pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence of
pulmonary edema.  EG tube position is adequate.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

#1.  NEUROLOGICAL/PSYCHIATRIC:  The patient is status post
overdose with multiple medications, unclear quantity taken,
given positive serum TCA at outside hospital and borderline
EKG changes with widened QRS complex, as well as borderline
QTC prolongation.  The patient was followed with serial EKGs.
The EKG changes, QRS, as well as prolonged QT resolved.  The
electrolytes including calcium, magnesium, and potassium were
repleted aggressively.  The patient was ruled out for
myocardial infarction given concern of tricyclic overdose as
well as concomitant cocaine use, the patient was initially
hypotensive.  She was weaned off the dopamine drip in the six
hours after she was admitted.  She was given fluid boluses
for hypotension to which she responded appropriately.  After
being weaned off pressors, the patient actually had episodes
of hypertension, given her history of hypertension.  She was
started on Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d.; however, this was
discontinued once the home regimen was evaluated and she was
started on Metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d. as well as
Enalapril 2.5 mg q.d.  The patient was maintained with a 1:1 24-
hour sitter, and evaluated by Psychiatry Consultation Service.

#2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Given presentation with hypotension
of unclear etiology, the patient was worked up with blood and
urine cultures, both of which showed no growth.  Chest x-ray
remained clear with no evidence of aspiration pneumonia and
the patient did not receive any antibiotics.

#3.  RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient was quickly weaned off
assist control and changed to pressure support and extubated
within a day of her admission as her mental status improved
and she had a good gag and cough reflex.  The patient
continues to have sputum, but is able to clear it adequately.

#4.  RENAL:  The patient's initial elevated creatinine
improved with hydration and she had good urine output.  She
was initially treated with aggressive IV fluids at 125 cc an
hour normal saline.  The patient then developed hyponatremia.
IV fluids were discontinued, and the patient was treated with
free water with good resolution of sodium.  Upon discharge,
the patient's sodium level was 140.

#5.  GI:  Given the concern of abnormal liver function tests
subsequent to Tylenol overdose, the patient's LFTs, INR, and
glucose were followed.  They remained normal throughout the
hospital course.  The patient was treated with acetylcysteine
total of 17 doses.

#6.  PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was initially on Lansoprazole,
which was switched to Protonix.  The patient was also kept on
heparin subcutaneously, given that she was bed bound.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was cleared medically with no
active medical issues.  The hypertension was well controlled
on her current regimen.  The patient was seen by the
Department of Psychiatry, who recommended hospitalization at
[**Hospital 16093**] Hospital if the patient was not actively suicidal
during the rest of her hospital, 1:1 sitter was discontinued.
 The patient will benefit from inpatient stay with support,
clarification of medication goals, and further set up of
outpatient treatment, as well as meetings with her husband.

UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST: Comparison is made to [**2-14**] and
[**2142-2-19**], exams.

Study is slightly limited by patient motion. In the interval,
the degree of
pulmonary edema appears improved with slightly decreased
prominence of the
pulmonary vascularity. There is unchanged extensive retrocardiac
consolidation
obscuring the majority of the left hemidiaphragm with persistent
blunting of
the left CP angle, likely related to small effusion. Exam is
otherwise
unchanged from prior with persistent cardiomegaly. A catheter is
seen
projecting over the abdomen, partially imaged.

IMPRESSION:

Slight improvement in pulmonary edema with persistent
retrocardiac opacity,
which again may represent atelectasis versus underlying
pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
24 yo woman with hx of SLE, ERSD on HD, admitted hypotension and
decreased mental status. Hypotension and altered mental status
were in the setting of excessive narcotic use. Patient's
narcotics were held, pressors returned to [**Location 213**] and patient was
mentating fine. Hct was below baseline and patient was
transfused 1u PRBC and was given HD before discharge. Patient is
to continue anti-hypertensive medications as previously
scheduled. Patient was encouraged to take less pain medications
and to use morphine (already previously written for) rather than
dilaudid for pain control.

# Change in mental status:  Resolved, patient took dilaudid this
morning and was noticed to be unresponsive shortly thereafter.
Patient received 1 dose of narcan with slight improvement in BP
and mental status.  patient without fevers or leuckocytosis
which argue against infection.

# Hypertension ?????? resumed outpatient regimen. Patient did not
have any hypertensive episodes requiring hydralizine 10mg IV.

# Hypotension: resolved, Patient normotensive on arrival to ICU.
 Relative hypotension likely due to dilaudid.  Other
considerations include sepsis, although patient without
objective signs of infection. Held pain medications and
hypotension resolved. Resumed hypertensive medications.

# Abdominal pain ?????? from previous peritoneal [**Location 2286**] hematoma ??????
pain under control
patient should use morphine instead of dilaudid

# Hyperkalemia: Likely due to missed HD session.  She received
calcium, D5, insulin and kayexalate in ED. HD in am

ESRD: Renal following, had HD the day of discharge, transfused
while there.  Will continue normal schedule as an outpatient
with HD T/Th/F this week.

# Metabolic Acidosis: likely due to renal failure and missed HD.


# SLE:  continued prednisone at 4 mg PO daily.

# OSA: CPAP for sleep with 7 pressure, however patient refuses.
Continued to offer as inpatient.  Should try to follow up with
sleep medicine.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 79666**] is a 31 year old man with a history of
hypertension and polysubstance abuse who was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED from [**Hospital1 **] following a multiday
drug/alcohol binge and now change in mental status.  His
girlfriend called EMS on [**7-14**] after she went to his apartment
because she hadn??????t heard from him since [**7-12**]; when she last
heard from him, he was at his baseline mental status.  She
reports that he was in a dark room and was acting very strangely
including laughing inappropriately, shaking, and sweating.  He
reported to her that he had smoked crack but couldn??????t say when
that was; given all of this, she brought him to
[**Hospital1 **] ED.  His girlfriend also reports that he
routinely binges on OxyContin (taking [**6-28**] 80 mg tablets daily)
and also takes large amounts of Klonopin and Xanax, which he
buys from his neighbor; she is unsure if he was taking these as
well, but assumed that he had been.
.
At [**Hospital3 8834**] where he was initially awake but
confused.  He was given IV ondansetron, activated charcoal, and
sorbitol 50 mg.  He was noted to vomit and then reportedly
became unresponsive with reported decerebrate posturing on the
left side and decorticate posturing on the right side and so he
was intubated via rapid sequence intubation and put on a
propofol drip.  He had a normal CT scan of his head and a
toxicology screen was positive only for benzodiazepines.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurologic evaluation.
.
Upon arrival to our ED, he was afebrile, HR 144, BP 119/69, RR
28, Sat 98% on the ventilator.  He extubated himself around 4am
and was able to say that he had not taken any substances for the
past two days or so.  He reportedly complained of dyspnea and
was thought to not be protecting his airway and was thus
reintubated.  He was given 1000 mg of IV vancomycin, [**2186**] mg of
IV ceftriaxone, [**2186**] mg of IV ampicillin, and 500 mg of IV
acyclovir though, per the ED resident, there was no concern for
meningitis/encephalitis and so no LP was performed.
.
On questioning now, the patient indicates that it has been
several days since he has taken any substances but is unable to
say exactly when he stopped taking them.  He does indicate that
he was taking the drugs to get high.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 31yo Male admited for altered mental status presumably
after an Oxycontin/Benzo binge as suicide attempt. At [**Location (un) **]
[**Location (un) 1459**] ED, the patient recieved charcoal and sorbitol, but
later vomited, became diaphoretic, tachychardic and
unresponsive, with decerebrate posturing on the left and
decorticate posturing on the right. He was intubated. His drug
screen was positive only for benzos. He was trasnferred to the
[**Hospital1 **] for further care.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, HR 144, BP 119/69, RR 28 with 02 saturations
98% on ventilator. He was given Thiamine, Veccuronium,
Ceftriaxone, Acyclovir, Ampiciliin, Versed, Fentanyl, as his
course was complicated by self-extubation followed by
re-intubation after the patient became dyspneac. While at first
there was some concern for meningitis (hence the regimen above),
the team subsequently determined that there suspicion was low
and no LP was performed. The patient was trasfered intubated to
the MICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient showed t98.4, HR 122, BP
148/89, RR 20. After extubation pt halucinated and was tremulous
and was started on a CIWA scale with lorazepam IV. As his mental
status improved he was switched to PO valium with good effect.
Psych and SW were consulted. Once lucid, the patient reported
that this OD was a suicide attempt as further described below.
.
Course otherwise described by problem below:

1. Substance abuse/dependence: It appears that the current
episode was due to snorting of oxycontin and was a suicide
attempt.  The patient may have been abusing benzos as well in
the days prior to presentation.  No cocaine on current tox
screens, but screen was positive for benzos. SW and psych were
consulted and recommended continuing PO valium per CIWA
protocol. PO thiamine, folic acid, multivitamin also given
during the hospitalizaiton.
Psychiatry consult noted that the patient reports he became
distraught and hopeless after his girlfriend  gave him an
ultimatutm  that he needed to quit drugs or she and her son
would leave. Over the last two weeks before admission, he
reportedly made statements to his mom and girlfriend that he was
going to kill himslef. + Hopelessness, anhedonia, SI before
hoispitalization, but denied SI in the hospital. Psychiatry aslo
noted that the patient apparently tried to commit suicide at age
18. The patient reported trying to OD on ""multiple drugs two
weeks ago"". The patient was deemed unable to care for himself
and met the criteria for Section 12. Although he does not want
to go to a rehab facility, the decision was made that it was in
his best interest to do so, and Section 12 was filed.

2. Altered mental status: very likely from some combination of
withdrawl and/or intoxication. No evidence to suggest
meningitis/encephalitis, LP was not performed. He recieved
Methadone, Haldol and Valium CIWA for delerium, but by [**7-16**], was
alert and oriented, with a much clearer mental status.

3. Respiratory failure: resolved over course.  Thought due to
inability to protect airway in the setting of altered mental
status, though CXR showed no signs of aspiration, and patient
was afebrile throughout course. The patient was extubated on
[**7-15**].
.
4. Hemoconcentration: also resolved over course. Thought
secondary to presumed poor PO intake. Pt reports not eating or
drinking for 4 days prior to admission, just snorting oxycodone
and taking Benzos.
.
5. Hypertension/Home medications: The patient remained
hypertensive to the 140-150/80's in the unit. The patient's
anti-hypertensive and home mediation regimen was difficult to
establish. Empty bottles prescribed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of the
following were found at home: Atenolol 50 QD, Lisinopril 5mg QD,
Ambien 10mg HS, Doxepin 50mg QD, Nabumetone 750 mg [**Hospital1 **], Percocet
TID PRN. The patient did not recieve anti-hypertensive
medications during his MICU course. Today, we were able to
establish with the patient's pharmacy that on [**6-3**], the
patient filled prescriptions for Atenolol 50QD and Doxepin 50mg
QD. The patient currently has a Clonidine patch .3%; we
recommned that his Atenolol be slowly reintroduced. Depending on

completely at his baseline at 3PM yesterday afternoon. Had no
compliants. Also spoke to him at 8:30PM and was fine.
Reportedly, he was at a friend's house last evening, and somehow
made it back home, where he lives with his brother. His brother
found him on his bed mildly responsive, gurgling, with labored
respirations. He was also noted to have vomit all over him. EMS
was called. He received 4 mg of narcan IM without response. He
was brought to [**Hospital **] Hospital, satting 86% on NRB (ABG
7.05/77/41) and intubated. RR was 34, pulse 128. CT head read as
normal. CXR showed patchy infiltrates. U/A negative. He had a
WBC of 22, glu 400. Pt was given azithromycin and CTX as well as
Lasix 60 mg, 6 units of insulin. Urine positive for opiates. Pt
was also noted to be in a fib with rate of 130s, converted after
given diltazem 60 mg bolus and started on gtt. He also received
a total of 12 mg of ativan for sedation.

IMAGES:
CXR [**2120-11-20**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a
clear
improvement. The lung volumes have increased, also increased is
the
transparency of the lung parenchyma. Some remnant right basal
and left mid and lower lung opacities are seen, including some
areas of retrocardiac atelectasis, but both the distribution and
the severity is less extensive than on the previous radiograph.
The size of the cardiac silhouette has slightly decreased. There
is no evidence of overhydration and no evidence of newly
appeared focal parenchymal opacities. On today's radiograph, the
tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4 cm above the carina. The
course of the nasogastric tube is unchanged. No evidence of
pleural effusions
.
CXR [**11-19**] - Diffuse consolidation and nodules are concerning for
metastatic disease or septic emboli, athough cavitation often
present with septic emboli are not seen.
.
EKG [**11-19**] -  Sinus rhythm. Short P-R interval. Normal tracing
for age. No previous tracing available for comparison.


Brief Hospital Course:
31 yo M with history of narcotic/heroin abuse found
unresponsive, respiratory failure, intubated at OSH.
.
1. Respiratory failure: Attributed to respiratory depression and
neurogenic pulmonary edema in the setting of narcotic overdose.
Elevated A-a gradient and ARDS criteria warranted low tidal
volume ventilation. CXR on HD#2 showed resolution of diffuse
left-sided patchy interstitial opacities. Weaned to PSV and
extubated to nasal cannula on HD#2. Called out to floor in no
distress, satting well on room air, no further issues.
.
2. Aspiration pneumonia v. pneumonitis:  As above.  No signs of
septic shock (briefly hypotensive after starting propofol,
improved with weaning of dilt). Started on empiric
ceftriaxone/clindamycin. Switched to levofloxacin on [**11-21**] for
CAP coverage given persistent fever, cough, & hypoxemia.
Discharged on short course of levofloxacin.
.
3. HCT drop, plt drop.  [**Month (only) 116**] have been dry.  Stable since repeat.
 No schistocytes on smear. Hct stable on discharge.
.
4. Atrial fibrillation:  Likely secondary to hypoxemia.
Converted to SR on diltiazem gtt which was discontinued upon
arrival in the MICU. [**Month (only) 116**] benefit from outpatient echo to
evaluate for structural heart disease.
.
5. NSTEMI:  Likely subendocardial ischemia in the contextof
respiratory failure atrial fibrillation.  Trending down the
normal range without intervention.
.
6. Substance Abuse: Social work consulted when pt stable on
floor. Was given plenty of information regarding AA/NA.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 yo M with stage IIIa NSCLC, HCV cirrhosis, CAD, HTN,
depression, presents with altered mental status.
.
.
Altered Mental Status: Patient had double-dose of his sustained
released morphine accidentally prior to radiation therapy. In
the ER he was started in a Narcan drip improving rapidly. He was
monitored for 24 hours in the MICU Green, where the drip was
shut off immediately upon arrival. HE was stable and was sent to
the oncology floor. His morphine doses were held as well as
amitriptilin. He had normal LFTs.
.
Acute on Chronic Cholangitis: Patient developed in the hospital
RUQ pain and increase bilirubin and fever up to 103. He
underwent an abdominal CT scan that showed worsening of his
chronic cholecystitis with large amount of fluid surrounding the
gallbladder. Patient was hydrated and started on Vancomycin /
Ciprofloxacin / Flagyl. Surgery was consulted, who suggested
percutaneous-IR-guided drainage of the gallbladder. The
following day patient underwent IR-drainage. Surgery recommended
leaving the drain permanently. Patient kept having RUQ pain and
fever despite prior interventions. Antibiotics were switched to
Vancomycin / Cefepime / Flagyl. Blood cultures were drawn on
daily basis and were negative. Then, biliary tract cultures grew
 ESCHERICHIA COLI that was ciprofloxacin resistant (Cefepime and
ceftriaxone sensitive). Infectious disease team was consulted.
Two days after switching the antibiotics patient became
afebrile. Vancomycin was stopped since the pt is MRSA negative
and the infection source is the biliary tract. The following day
he was switched to ceftriaxone and oral flagyl. He kept being
afebrile. He will have an indeterminate course of antibiotics at
this time. Therefore, he will be followed by infectious disease
team as outpatient who will determined when to stop antibiotics.
.
NCSLC: undergoing chemoradiation currently.  He became
neutropenic while in the hospital and then counts recovered. He
will continue with radiotherapy as outpatient.
.
HCV cirrhosis: Currently appears compensated.  Synthetic
function at baseline.  Transaminases at baseline.  No signs of
encephalopathy.  Has grade II varices per EGD in [**2140**]. Lactulose
/ Rifaximin / Propranolol were continued.
.
Chronic Pain:  Patient has back pain and chest pain due to his
malignancy and treatment.  His pain medications were slowly
uptitrated until his home-dose morphine SR. He was discharged
with PO Dilaudid for breakthrough.

Discharge Instructions:
You were seen at [**Hospital1 18**] for sleepiness and altered mental status.
The most likely etiology was your double-dose of morphine. You
required an antidote of morphine in the ICU and you improved.
You were watched for more than 24 hours. Then you were tranfered
to the floor and your pain regimen was re-established. You had
your raditaion therapy. Then later in the admission, most likely
in the setting of low white blood cells, you had an acute on
chronic cholecystitis (inflammation of gallbladder and bile
ducts) with a lot of fluid that was much worse than before. You
were seen by surgery who recommended percutaneous drainage.
Interventional radiology placed the drain. You kept having
fevers, so we consulted the infectious disease and changed the
antibiotics. You have been afebrile and are tolerating diet and
ambulating. You will need to follow with infectious disease
doctors and with your oncologist.

You will need to follow with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to assess fof further
therapy (i.e. chemotherapy) once your infection is better.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 45 year old
type 1 diabetic male with known coronary artery disease,
status post stenting who presents with chest pain which began
at 11 A.M.  The patient reports he climbed a flight of stairs
and experienced dyspnea although he has had one month of
dyspnea on exertion, then ten minutes after while at rest
developed substernal epigastric pain radiating to the left
arm and back.  Patient reports chest pain was 7 to 8 out of
10 and slowly reported to 3 or 4 out of 10 with morphine.  He
denies any nausea or vomiting, diaphoresis or shortness of
breath at rest.  Describes the pain as a pressure.  When he
had a stent in [**2118**] he complained of dyspnea on exertion as
well.  He has never had an myocardial infarction.  Patient
reports similar episode of chest pressure in [**9-20**] where he
had a stress test that was ""fine"" and required no further
follow up.  Patient originally moved here from [**Location (un) 20309**],
[**State 15946**], has no medical care in [**Location (un) 86**].  Patient's
cardiologist, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3748**] in [**Location (un) 20309**], took care of patient
during last stenting procedure.  Patient denies any
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no orthopnea.  He does report
dyspnea on exertion and fatigue.  In the emergency department
the pain responded pretty much to morphine.  Patient received
aspirin, beta blocker, Mucomyst and gastrointestinal
cocktail.  Electrocardiogram was sinus at 100 with normal
intervals, normal axis, poor R wave progression, T wave
inversion in lead 3, no ST changes noted.

PREVIOUS MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes type 1, end stage renal
disease, status post kidney transplant in [**2100**], blindness
with two prosthetic eyes.  Coronary artery disease, status
post stents of the RCA.  Neck:  Pituitary infarcts.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.  Chronic rectal pain which
patient has had since age of 13.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Include Humalog insulin pump, Lescol,
BuSpar, methadone 10 B.I.D for chronic rectal pain which
patient has had since the age of 13.  Clonazepam 1.5 q.d.,
prednisone 5 q.d., azathioprine, atenolol 25 q.d., Lasix 20
B.I.D, Aldactone B.I.D, aspirin 81, vitamin E and Paxil.
Patient reports he is allergic to erythromycin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Denies any tobacco use, no alcohol use.  Is
married.  Wife is very involved with his medical care.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission heart rate 98, blood
pressure 110/56, patient was afebrile, in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Prosthetic eyes.  Mucous
membranes mucoid.  Jugular venous pressure approximately 9
cm.  Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes,
rubs, crackles.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm,
S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdominal examination:
Mildly distended, normal bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly
noted.  An area over transplanted kidney is nontender,
nonerythematous.  Skin:  No rashes.  Extremities:  Decreased
pulses bilaterally.  Neurologic:  Alert and oriented times
three, [**5-22**] upper and lower extremity strength.

Patient's hematocrit 44.9 with admission white count 8.8,
creatinine 1.2.  Patient's first set of cardiac enzymes - CK
135, MB 2, troponin less than 0.01.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 44 year old man with type 1
diabetes, coronary artery disease, status post stents done in
[**State 15946**] presenting with substernal chest pressure that
started with exertion and only relieved by morphine.
According to the history this pain ever since this stent was
placed, reports that it is the same pain he has had for six
months and he has been recently hospitalized for in the past.
Patient also reports a recent hospitalization in [**State 15946**] for
pneumonia.  Patient's last admission for this chest pain on
further history on hospital day that he was told it was
gastroesophageal reflux disease but never relieve this.  No
gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms recently.  Patient
reports that it usually goes away after a few days.
Nitroglycerine never helps but it only gives him a headache.
Patient reports he has been on chronic pain since the age of
13 for rectal spasm and he needs higher doses of spasm.  In
the past Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital **] Clinic has been patient's
primary care prior to his move to [**State 15946**] many years ago.
Patient's cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**], [**Name (NI) 653**] in [**State 15946**] who
reports patient had a MIBI in [**2118**] which demonstrated small
inferior wall defect.  In [**2118-8-18**] patient had a distal
right stent placed as well as a mid circumflex stent placed.
Patient underwent a stress PMIBI in [**2119**] which was a negative
study and demonstrated an ejection fraction of 61 percent.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] also reports patient had a MRSA positive groin
abscess complicating his last hospitalization.  CT on [**5-31**]
demonstrated no aortic dissection aneurysm, intramural
hematoma.  It did demonstrate mediastinal lipomatosis which
was known by patient prior to this CT and two 2 mm
noncalcified pulmonary nodules in the right upper lobe and
right lower lobe, incompletely imaged transplanted kidney
with suggestion of dilated collecting system and parapelvic
cysts.  Patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction by
enzymes times three.  Persantine MIBI demonstrated mild
perfusion defect of the inferior wall.  Resting perfusion
images showed resolution of this defect.  Patient had mild
chest pain throughout this test.  Ejection fraction was
calculated at 59 percent.  Patient complained of persistent
pain.  Cardiology consult was obtained and patient was taken
for catheterization on [**6-3**].  At that time coronary
angiography of his right dominant circulation revealed single
vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main coronary
artery had no obstructions.  Left anterior descending
coronary artery had mild luminal irregularities without
limiting lesions.  The left circumflex had widely patent
stents.  The right coronary artery had an 80 percent in stent
restenosis in the distal vessel.  Stenting of the right
coronary artery was performed with a 2.5 x 18 mm Cipher
stent.  Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis,
no dissection and TIMI3 flow.  Integrelin was stopped at the
end of the case due to the patient's viral syndrome and
severe cough.  Patient returned to the floor.

In the evening following catheterization patient underwent an
post catheterization examination at 10 P.M. at which point he
was in good spirits and his baseline mental status.  However,
he had little urine output post catheterization so a Foley
catheter was placed and 1400 cc came out.  Night float
resident returned to re-evaluate patient's urine output at
midnight and found that he was having increased difficulty
getting words out.  He seemed to have an acute mental status
change.  Neurology team was called.  The team believed this
may have been a stroke.  Head CT was done which was negative
for a bleed.  MRI was not obtained as the patient had a new
metal stent that was less than 24 hours old and this a
contraindication to MRI.  Patient's family was notified and
attending physician was notified.  According to his wife
patient has a had prior history of word finding trouble in
the past when he had hypoglycemia and was overdosing on
narcotics.  Patient was started on a heparin drip and felt to
have question of an acute stroke versus a new metabolic
stress causing Broca 's' aphasia.  Patient was continued on
his aspirin and Plavix and underwent careful follow up.
Patient's blood pressure was allowed to autoregulate per
neuro recommendation.  Patient's mental status waxed and
waned over the next 24 hours.  Repeat CT demonstrated no
acute bleed, no brain edema or midline shift.  The plan was
obtain a transesophageal echocardiogram as well as carotid
study.  Carotid study was negative.  Transesophageal
ultrasound was delayed as patient had a history of dysphagia.
He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which was notable
for small hiatal hernia as well as a widely patent Schatzki
ring in the lower esophagus.  The web was not dilated.
Patient to return for further gastrointestinal follow up
after his acute issues have resolved.

Overnight from [**6-4**] to [**6-5**] patient developed increasing
hypoxia with some evidence of aspiration pneumonia and a
worsening lung examination.  The hypoxia cleared the day
after patient's esophagogastroduodenoscopy evaluation.  It
was felt that patient likely had a new aspiration pneumonia.
At 1 A.M. on the morning of [**6-5**] the patient's room air
saturations were 88 percent.  Patient deteriorated over the
course of the night and required a face mask.  Arterial blood
gas was 7.43, 41, 50, lactate of 1.2.  Repeat CT of the head
negative for bleed.  At this time the patient spiked a
temperature to 102 and had worsened aphasia, hypoxia and a
worsening mental status.  The patient no longer recognized
his wife and was unable to answer any questions.  Medical
Intensive Care Unit evaluation was requested at that time and
care was transferred to the Intensive Care team.

Other issues evaluated during [**Hospital 228**] hospital course from
[**5-31**] to [**6-5**]:

1. Renal transplant:  A renal transplantation team was
   consulted and followed patient throughout this portion of
   his hospital course.  He was maintained on his anti
   rejection medication.  He was treated with Mucomyst prior
   to contrast administration and given intravenous fluids
   based on renal transplantation team recommendations.

1. Endocrine:  Patient had a normal TSH and T4 but in light
   of his history of immunosuppression and pituitary infarct
   he was given stress dose steroids prior to his cardiac
   catheterization.

1. Lung nodules:  The patient had lung nodules noted on his
   CT and will need follow up CT in a few months.  A PPD was
   placed and read as negative.

1. Diabetes:  Patient initially was on his home insulin pump.
   However, the battery and pump ran out prior to patient's
   cardiac catheterization.  Patient was transitioned to an
   insulin drip after his development of Broca's aphasia as
   he was no longer able to manage his insulin pump and
   become unsafe.

1. Rectal pain:  Patient has persistent chronic rectal pain.
   His methadone maintenance was increased over the first few
   days of his hospitalization in an attempt to help control
   his chronic chest pain which was unrelieved by
   catheterization.  However, it was noted patient had a
   worsened mental status with increased dose of methadone.
   The methadone dose was decreased back to patient's
   baseline dosing with good effect.

This completes the dictation for the portion of [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course from [**5-31**] to [**6-5**] when his care was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit Team.

.
[**2140-4-7**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Anterolateral T wave changes are probably due to left
ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2140-2-5**] no significant change.
.
[**2140-4-11**] ECG: Normal sinus rhythm. Voltage criteria for left

interim change.
.
[**2140-4-12**] ECG: Normal sinus rhythm. Compared to tracing #1 no
diagnostic interim change.
.
[**2140-4-17**] MR BRAIN/HEAD: 1. Left globe subchoroidal and vitreous
hemorrhage with possible retinal detachment; lens not clearly
visualized, which could be due to resorption/displacement.
Patient needs ophthalmologic examination, for better evaluation.
2. No evidence of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.
3. Hypoplastic left transverse, sigmoid, anterior-superior
sagittal sinuses, and inferior sagittal sinus.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Malignant HTN: Pt on lisinopril, valsartan, clonidine patch,
labetolol, nicardipine as an outpatient with a baseline bp
160s-180s/80s-100s. Pt was in the ICU intermittently on a
labetolol drip. Labetolol was increased and terazosin added and
titrated up. Her hypertension was exacerbated by left eye
pain/headache, which was managed as below. Plasma metanephrines,
Renin, aldosterone pending.
.
2) Left Uveitis/endophthalmitis: The patient was evaluated by
ophthomology, who noted normal OCP and felt her findings were
consistent with uveitis. She was treated with
atropine/prednisolone eye drops. Neurology was consulted to
assist with evaluation of other causes of headache; they felt
her symptoms were also most likely secondary to uveitis. She had
a MRI/MRV of her head which was without evidence of sinus
thrombosis. She required high doses of narcotics. She developed
[**Female First Name (un) **] endophthalmitis, sent for L eye enucleation [**4-20**] given
risk for autoimmune attack in contralateral eye. She is to have

History of Present Illness:
This is 62 year old male with history of transverse myelitis
complicated by paraplegia who presents with two days of
shortness of breath. The patient has had a complicated recent
history involving a leg fracture sustained while moving in his
wheel chair. This was not treated surgically. He also has a
sacral decub which was treated with 2 weeks of cipro then 2
weeks of levofloxacin. Over the past two days he has been having
increasing shortness of breath. He has oxygen at home which he
normally does not use. He has been using up to 4L 1 day PTA. He
reports no fevers of chills. He has been taking his temp and no
documented fevers. He does not endorse ant chest pain. His wife
notes that although his right leg is constantly swollen from the
fracture, his left leg has been having increasing swelling over
the past few days. His wife also notes that he has been
increasingly lethargic over the past few days as well.

In the ED, he recieved Vanc and Zosyn.  CTA neg for PE but
showed no central PE but Bibasal GGO and more consolidative opc
w/enlarged subcarinal [**Last Name (un) **] ? pna.

Upon arrival to the floor his sats were in the 80s on NC and he
required a NRB to attain sats in the 90s. An ABG was performed
7.49/44/141. He was given 20mg IV lasix. He was eventually able
to be placed on a 40% venturi mask. His oral temp was 99.7. He
was short of breath when not on the NRB.

IMAGING

 CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2164-2-14**]
2:22 PM
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Progressed interstitial lung disease including honeycombing,
cylindrical bronchiectasis, and diffuse ground-glass
opacification predominantly in the lower lobes. Nonspecific
interstitial pneumonia is a primary diagnostic consideration,
with the possibility of superimposed aspiration suggested
particularly in light of the patulous esophagus. Although
unlikely given age, connective tissue disease may also present
in this manner. It would be atypical however to present at this
advanced age.
3. Meidastinal adenopathy. Given relative dramatic sizes, felt
out of
proportion to be reactive nodes. Follow up CT in [**2-3**] months
recommended to
further evaluate.
4. Large hiatal hernia with patulous esophagus. Contributes to
possibility
of superimposed aspiration.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2164-2-15**] at 11:13:00 AM  FINAL
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging
suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal regional and global biventricular systolic
function. Mild mitral regurgitation. There appears to be a mass
that is external to the lateral and posterior sides of the right
atrium. This mass is indenting/compressing the right atrium
without causing hemodynamic compromise. This is probably the
same mass/lymhpadenopathy seen on the recent chest CT.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT Study Date of [**2164-2-15**] 8:04 AM
Limited study. Deep venous thrombosis in the left proximal and
mid femoral vein.

TIB/FIB (AP & LAT) RIGHT Study Date of [**2164-2-15**] 5:49 PM
Angulated and minimally displaced fractures involving the
proximal metaphyses of the tibia and fibula.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2164-2-21**] 11:00 AM
In comparison with the study of [**2-19**], there is little interval
change. Again there is striking dilatation of the
tracheobronchial tree.
Bibasilar areas of opacification persist, consistent with
consolidation
superimposed upon underlying interstitial lung disease.




Brief Hospital Course:
62M quadraparetic s/p transverse myelitis, sent to ICU from
floor for hypoxia and closer monitoring/nursing care.

# Hypoxia: CTA r/o PE but showed mostly dependent ground glass
opacity and concern for aspiration pneumonia pneumonitis vs CAP
vs ILD (less likely as spares apices) vs pulmonary edema.
Leukocytosis of 16.4, lactate 1.1.  He was initially started on
broad spectrum antibiotics including Vanco/Zosyn/Levaquin.
These were narrowed to Levoquin / Vanco on [**2-21**] given no
cultures had grown out.  The exact etiology of his hypoxia
remained somewhat unclear throughout his hospitalization but is
likely multifactorial including interstitial disease, likely
silent aspiration and anxiety.  He was started on steroids while
inpatient, with plan to have this tapered by his primary care.

# LE Edema: Pt with notable LE edema upon exam which by report
was new.  Bilateral, with some erythema which could represent
venous stasis vs cellulitis.  Ultrasound revealed DVT in his
left leg.  He was started on a heparin drip for this while
inpatient.  Upon discharge, continued anticoagulation was
discussed with his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Lovenox
was not a reasonable option due to his minimal subcutaneous fat.
 He was also taking minimal oral intake.  Given this, his PCP
recommended discharged without anticoagulation but plan to
consider it should his underlying poor health status change.

# Sacral decubiti: Multiple sacral decubiti, with some concern
of osteomyelitis per wife. Was [**Name2 (NI) 38511**] with levaquin as
outpatient, scheduled for Plastics evaluation as oupatient prior
to admission.  Was seen by Wound Care and Plastics who left
recommendations but did not think surgical intervention was
warranted given his overall decompensated state.  With these
interventions, his wounds showed interval improvement and he was
dishcarged with VNA services.

# Tibula /fibular fracture: Fracture sustained falling from WC.
This was not treated surgically. Continued in boot per Ortho
recommendations.

# Chronic pain: Pt is on several medications, including
methadone, dilaudid and Fentanyl.  His medications were changed
while inpatient and included IV Fentanyl.  Given minimal
subcutaneous fat, it is also unlikely that his Fentanyl patches
were working.  This was discussed extensively with the patient
and his wife, and they plan to continue to address his pain
issues as an outpatient with his PCP.

# Anxiety:  Patient with significant anxiety.  As outpatient is
reportedly on Alprazolam, Diazepam and Clonazepam.  During
hospitalization would become very agitated.  Ultimately started
on IV Ativan and Haldol PRN.  Discharged on Haldol PRN.

Brief Hospital Course:
24F with h/o SLE, ESRD on HD, malignant HTN, h/o SVC syndrome,
PRES, prior ICH, and recent SBO, p/w n/v, and hypertensive
urgency.
.
# hypertensive urgency - On presentation she denies chest pain,
but continues to have mild headache, and resolving shortness of
breath, likely [**2-12**] hypertension. states she did take her PO
meds. Hypertensive urgency was treated as follows with nitro and
labetalol gtt which were quickly weaned as blood pressures
dropped below SBP 120. She evenutally became hypotensive to SBP
of 90 which resolved on its own. She was continued on CPAP
overnight and discontinued in the am. She was continued on her
home regimen of oral labetolol, nifedipine, hydralazine,
aliskerin. She remained normotensive the following morning and
was taken to hemodialysis after which she was discharged home on
all of  her old home medications.
.
# abdominal pain - On presentation she was without n/v, soft
abdomen, passing flatus, and having daily bowel movements. She
did have hypoactive bowel sounds on admission. She was
maintained on outpt pain regimen of po dilaudid, fentanyl patch,
lidoacine patch, neurontin with HD with plan to follow BMs
closley. Her pain improved the am of discharge and she had no
further vomiting.
.
# ESRD on HD - She is currently getting HD SaTuTh, though did
not get HD on the day of presenation. As there was no acute
indication for HD on presentation, she received HD on the
following am, day of discharge.  She was continued on sevelamer.

.
# anemia - chronic anemia, likely [**2-12**] CKD and SLE, currently
above baseline, though has h/o GIB. She received 2 unit PRBCs
and epo with hemodialysis.
.
# h/o gastric ulcer - she was continued on her outpatient dose
of PPI [**Hospital1 **].
.
# SLE - continue home regimen of prednisone 4mg po qdaily.
.
# h/o SVC thrombosis - pt with goal INR [**2-13**], but this was
stopped after recent admission [**2-12**] supratherapeutic INR. INR
currently sub-therapeutic and she was resumed on warfarin at 3
mg qdaily without heparin bridge.
.
# seizure disorder - continued on keppra 1000 mg PO 3X/WEEK
(TU,TH,SA).
.
# depression - continued on celexa.

Brief Hospital Course:
KUB: SBO

Head CT: (prelim read from radiology). unchanged from prior head
CT, no intracranial hemorrhage

EKG: NSR, right axis, LVH, nl intervals, ST elevations V2-3
(old), TW inversion V6 (new) compared to prior EKG [**5-15**].

CT CHEST/ABD: Preliminary Read
Normal aorta without dissection or acute abnormality. No PE.
Stable trace
ascites and small right pleural effusion. Unchanged small
pulmonary nodules
and lymphadenopathy in the chest. No acute abnormalities in the
abdomen to
explain epigastric pain.

EGD: Ulcer at GE junction.

# Hypertensive urgency: This is a chronic issue related to ESRD.
Head CT was negative for intracranial bleed. Weaned off
Nicardipine gtt and BP well controlled on home regimen.
Continued her home regimen of: Aliskiren 150 mg po bid,
Clonidine 0.4 mg/24 hr Patch Weekly, Labetalol 1000 mg po TID,
Nifedipine 60 mg Tablet Sustained Release QPM and 90 mg Tablet
Sustained Release QAM, Hydralazine 100 mg PO Q8H. When BPs were
lower (see below) patient's BP meds were held occasionally, but
as she was transfused and the BPs started to trend back up the
meds were re-initiated. She then developed hypotension in the
setting of poor PO intake during her SBO. BP meds were held and
then re-initiated as the pressure came back up once she was able
to eat.

# Abdominal pain/UGIB: The patient has chronic abdominal pain
with previous negative workups. At first the pain resolved and
she was continued on her outpatient regimen of: 2-4 mg po
dilaudid q4 h as needed.  GI was c/s re: abd pain and rec
CTA-abdomen to eval for mesenteric ischemia vs. partial SBO,
however with ESRD did not initially want to get CTA so KUB was
ordered. This showed no SBO. They recommended checking urine
porphyrobilinogen and serum lead levels which were negative and
LFTs were at baseline. The patient then developed a different
type of pain associated with her incision site. Pain service was
consulted and did a bupivicaine injection at the site which did
help. They will continue to follow her. She then developed a
third type of pain associated with a burning sensation in her
chest. EKG was unchanged from prior. A few hours later she had 3
episodes of coffee-ground emesis. She was placed on IV PPI and
transfused two units of blood. Afterward the pain resolved and
her hct remained stable. GI felt that the patient would need
general anesthesia in order to undergo an EGD which showed an
ulcer at the GE junction. She was started on empiric treatment
for H. Pylori and serologies were sent which came back negative
so the antibiotics were stopped. Her pain was controlled with
her outpatient regimen of PO dilaudid. She will follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**6-18**] weeks to have another EGD under MAC to see if
there has been resolution of the ulcer.

# SBO: Continued to be nauseous and vomited intermittently. she
was started on reglan and continued on zofran and compazine PRN
howeve she continued to have n/v. A KUB was done which showed an
SBO. Surgery was consulted, NGT was placed, she was made NPO and
serial abdominal exams were done. Eventually she was able to
transition to clear diet and then tolerated a regular diet
without pain or vomiting.

#. Fever: On hospital day #6 she spiked a fever to 101. Blood
and urine cultures were sent and a cxr were negative, however
she then had a seizure and in the post-ictal state aspirated
after vomiting. She had an episode of hypoxia with this and was
transferred to the ICU. In the ICU LP was attempted to rule out
meningitis as a possible cause of a seizure but this was
unsuccessful. Broad spectrum antibiotics were initiated (vanc
ctx) at meningeal dosing. She improved over the next few days
and antibiotics were discontinued because the suspicion for a
bacterial meningitis was low.

#. Seizure: This occured in the setting of fever, hypotension,
and initiation of reglan for vomiting. Neurology was consulted
and felt she should be continued on keppra indefinitely. EEG was
non-revealing. She should be continued on keppra 1gm with
dialysis three times weekly.

# ESRD on HD: Hyperkalemia resolved with kayexalate. Underwent
dialysis on normal schedule.

# SLE: She was continued on prednisone 4mg daily. With multiple
abdominal symptoms it was thought she may have lupus flare in
the abdomen. C3, c4 were equivocal for active lupus flare, and
[**Doctor First Name **] was positive, as would be expected in lupus.

# Anemia: Has anemia of chronic renal disease and her Hct was
high on admission and epo was held per renal. However, her Hct
trended all the way down to 20 and she was borderline
hypotensive for her (ie SBP 120) and she developed coffee ground
emesis so she was transfused 2 units. Afterward her Hct was
stable at 25. She was also re-started on EPO per renal for her
chronic anemia. Hemolysis labs were negative.

# History of thrombotic events/SVC syndrome: She is
anticoagulated with warfarin as an outpatient. Previous
documentation in OMR states she does not need to be bridged
while subtherapeutic.  Continued coumadin 4 mg po daily however
INR became supratherapeutic and the coumadin was then held. She
was started on heparin gtt while awaiting EGD. After EGD the
coumadin was re-started at 3mg daily however, in setting of poor
po intake her INR was supratherapeutic - likely [**2-12**] nutritional
deficiency of vitamin k. coumadin will be restarted when INR [**2-13**]
at dialysis.

# OSA: She is on CPAP at a setting of 7 as an outpatient.
Continued CPAP

#. CIN1: On last pap had CIN1. OB/GYN service was called re:
doing colposcopy in hospital as patient rarely makes o/p
appointments, hwoever they do not do this procedure in hospital
especially because it does not have to be done emergently - just
within one year. Will need outpatient colposcopy at some point
in next few months as they do not do this procedure in the
hospital.

# RLL nodule:  A new 10 x 5 mm nodularity was found incidentally
within the right lower lobe of the lung on an abdominal CT.
This should be reassessed in 3 months.

# ACCESS: PIV, right groin HD line
# CODE: Full code

History of Present Illness:
51yo woman w/severe COPD on home O2 and home BIPAP who presented
to the ED c/o worsening SOB x2 weeks. She initially developed
this 2 weeks ago at which point she called her [**First Name3 (LF) 19039**] who
started her on prednisone 40 and azithro. She did not feel any
better after five days of azithromycin, so she was then treated
with levofloxacin (last day day of admission). She finished the
prednisone 2 days prior to admission. She reports increasing
shortness of breath to the point where she cannot walk from the
bathroom to the bedroom. This is also accompanied by bilateral
chest pain that feels like ""lung soreness"", and resolves with
rest. It is also accompanied by mild nausea. She initially had a
productive cough of thick green sputum which was somewhat better
after the antibiotic treatment but still present. She traveled
recently to [**State 760**] via bus and may have had sick contacts.
She was originally using her nebulizer treatments up to 4x/day
which was helpful, but has stopped doing that lately.

In the ED, she was initially saturating 68% on 1L, which
increased to 94% on 4L. She then became somewhat confused and so
the oxygen was turned down. On admission, she was saturating in
the 80s on 1L. She was put on nasal CPAP on her home settings
([**9-11**]). Her ABG was 7.39/56/50. She was given albuterol and
atrovent nebulizers, solumedrol, and aspirin.

Past Medical History:
1. COPD, followed in pulmonary by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. [**5-13**] PFTs show
FEV1 of 1.04, which is 42 percent of predicted, and a FVC of
2.11, which is 65 percent of predicted. FEV1/FVC ratio is 0.49
Full PFTs from [**10-12**] also showed diffusion capacity 45% pred.
Exercise oximetry showed O2 sat 88%RA at rest, which decreased
to 80% w/ambulation. ABG at that time 7.34/56/52 on RA.

Brief Hospital Course:
51yo woman with COPD admitted to the ICU w/ COPD exacerbation,
transferred to the floor after solumedrol, nebulizers, and BiPAP
(home settings), with quick resolution to baseline oxygenation.

Hospital course is reviewed below by problem:

1. COPD exacerbation: s/p levofloxacin and azithromycin as an
outpatient. She was treated with advair, atrovent nebulizers,
albuterol nebs (concern for chest pain, see below), solumedrol,
BIPAP, O2 prn. She was not given supplemental O2 unless her
saturations were <88%, since this caused oxygen narcosis. She
was given solumedrol and discharged with a prednisone taper. She
was discharged with saturations in the mid-90's on room air.
completed courses of levo/azithro prior to admit

2. Chest pain: She had an episode of chest pain prior to
admission that was likely related to her COPD exacerbation. She
had no EKG changes and cardiac enyzmes were negative. She was
monitored by telemetry without events. The pain seemed to be
associated with beta-agonists, so these were minimized. She was
continued on aspirin and started on atorvastatin for
hyperlipidemia. She had an appointment scheduled with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on discharge to further work up the chest pain, as it
sounded cardiac in etiology (left-sided, into left arm,
associated with beta agonists). She may benefit from a stress
test, or possibly should go directly to catheterization, to be
determined by cardiology.

3. Leukocytosis: Thought to be due to steroids or stress
response. Bcx were negative. She had already completed
levofloxacin and azithromycin courses for COPD exacerbation. She
remained afebrile throughout hospitalization.

4. Anemia: Her Hct fell from 36 to 30, which was thought to be
due to hydration. Her studies were consistent with iron
deficiency. She was started on iron. Would benefit from
outpatient work up including colonoscopy.

5. Seizure disorder: She was continued on keppra.

6. IVDU: Her methadone maintenance was continued.

placement

History of Present Illness:
23 y.o. Male w/ h.o. Benzo and Heroin [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital 21242**]
hospital after being found down in PEA arrest likely [**1-20**] Heroin
OD.
.
Per ED signout pt was found by passer by this AM unconcious, EMS
was called and found him in PEA arrest, they coded him in the
field for 20 minutes which included 3 rounds of Epinephrine,
Atropine, 8 of Narcan. Pt was taken to Widden ED where he coded
again and reecived 2 rounds of medications. He was found to be
in V. fib and received 1 shock, he was then noted to be
irregular WCT thought to be A. fib with aberrancy. He was
?intubated at Widden with an ABG notable for acidosis. He was
then placed on Artic Sun and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. In the ED
he was noted to be sinus tach, overbreathing the vent. Unclear
but EMS thought pt did have somewhat of a gag at Widden. In the
ED he had an A-line placed, has 2PIVs.
.
In discussion with the family it is unclear if this was an
attempt on his life versus taking an excessive amount of heroin.
Per grandmother pt usually is someone who takes substances in
excess. Per grandmother pt has also been very depressed, 2 weeks
he overdosed at his grandmother's house though it is not clear
if this was an attempt. His girlfriend apparently overdosed last
week. Pt was interested in sobriety from his heroin habit and
was being seen at Connections where his urine was negative for
heroin last week.
.
On the floor, he was noted to be on a cooling blanket, sinus
tachycardia to 110s and BP 120s on Levophed. Pt already
intubated with RR 14 which was increased to 20, PEEP 5, FiO2
50%.

IMAGING: HEAD MRI [**9-13**]: FINDINGS: I concur with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
comprehensive assessment. Indeed, as
noted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3012**], widespread diffusion and T2 signal
abnormalities of the
brain indicate extensive hypoxic ischemic injury. There is no
susceptibility
abnormality within the brain seen to suggest the presence of a
hemorrhage.
There is mild prominence of the anterior communicating artery,
as noted on
both the axial T2 and susceptibility weighted images (see series
4, image 11
of the T2-weighted scan series), suggesting a possible aneurysm
v. vascular
loop. This finding could be evaluated more definitively with an
MR angiogram
if the patient's clinical condition permits this additional
examination. There
is high T2 signal within all paranasal sinuses, particularly the
sphenoid and
ethmoid sinuses, as well as the mastoid sinuses, which could
relate to the
intubated status of the patient. There is an artifact overlying
the midline
parietal bone area, which may relate to an EEG lead.

CONCLUSION: Diffuse hypoxic ischemic injury. See above report
for other
findings.

HEAD CT [**9-13**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Diffusely increased cerebral edema, with further sulcal
effacement and
slight narrowing of the lateral ventricles. No evidence of
herniation at this
time.
2. Evolution of hypodensities in the basal ganglia and internal
capsules,
consistent with infarct.
3. No intracranial hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
23 yom s/p PEA arrest in setting of heroin overdose transferred
from [**Hospital 21242**] hospital. Pt was admitted to MICU and cooled x24
hours c continuous EEG monitoring. Pt did require paralysis as
he was shivering when initially cooled. Head CT on admission
concerning for cerebral edema and pt was started on hyperosmolar
saline c goal osmolality of 320. Upon rewarming pt was found to
be posturing, neuro agreed that there was ongoing seizure
activity and started keppra and dilantin. Repeat head CT as well
as MRI showed worsening cerebral edema and ischemic changes.
Neurology and MICU attending met c family to discuss prognosis
and the decision was made to convert pt to CMO. Pt was
terminally extubated on [**2110-9-14**] and passed away shortly after.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 28-year-old male
status post motor vehicle accident into a tree.  Patient had
positive loss of consciousness and questionable respiratory
arrest.  The car, the patient was in, caught fire.  Patient
was extricated over 15 minutes by bystanders.  Patient was
not burned.  Patient was evaluated at outside hospital and
found to have bilateral pulmonary contusions, left
hemothorax, right pneumothorax, and a right posterior hip
dislocation.  Patient was intubated and paralyzed on
transfer.  Patient was also found to have a right
sternoclavicular dislocation at the outside hospital.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Depression.

MEDICATIONS:  Paxil.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient was using heroin during the last
month and had used heroin prior to this accident.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient had a temperature of 101,
heart rate of 120, blood pressure of 130/80.  Patient was
intubated and sedated, and was normocephalic, atraumatic.
Pupils are equal, round, and reactive.  Oropharynx was clear.
Tympanic membranes were intact.  Patient was sedated in a C
collar.  Heart was regular, rate, and rhythm, tachycardic.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Back had no
stepoffs and no deformities.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended with no masses.  Rectal with normal tone,
nonbloody.  Extremities had no visible deformities with 2+
pulses and warm extremities.  Neurologic:  Moving all
extremities and following commands.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Chemistries were all within
normal limits.  Patient had a hematocrit of 31, white count
of 10.3, lactate of 1.3.  Amylase of 76.  Patient's serum tox
was positive for benzodiazepines and opiates.  Urine tox was
negative.

Patient had a C spine CT showing no fractures or
dislocations.

Chest x-ray showed bilateral chest tubes that were placed at
the outside hospital.  No pneumothorax on the left.  There
was a small residual pneumothorax on the right.

Pelvis x-ray showed a right acetabular fracture.  TLSO films
were negative.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis were also
negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the Trauma SICU and
Orthopedics consult was obtained per the right acetabular
fracture.  A Psychiatry consult was also obtained to evaluate
the patient's drug use.  Patient was extubated on post-trauma
day #1 with no complications.  Patient's right lower
extremity was placed in Buck's traction until definitive
management was planned.  The patient was seen by Psychiatry
and deemed not to require methadone or any other
interventions for withdrawal.

Patient was then transferred to the floor, and was taken on
[**12-4**] to the OR for a right acetabular open reduction
internal fixation that had no complications.  Patient, after
several attempts of removing the chest tubes bilaterally with
subsequent pneumothoraces, a thoracic consult was obtained.
The patient then had his chest tubes clamped for four hours
and the chest tubes were successfully removed on [**12-10**] with
no pneumothoraces and no complications.

Patient was placed on Lovenox 30 mg b.i.d. for DVT
prophylaxis per Orthopedics service.  Patient was then deemed
to be stable and ready for rehabilitation.  It was also noted
that postoperatively, the patient's hematocrit dropped
slightly to 25 and he was transfused 1 unit of packed red
blood cells with adequate response with an increase of
hematocrit to 30, which was his baseline.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 53 year old man with HTLV-1 induced paraplegia and
depression/suicide attempts and decubitus ulcers who presents
with temperature to 101.2 degrees at nursing home, as well as
loose stools and abdominal destension with no stool in the
rectal vault. He had recently been diagnosed with bibaslilar
pneumonia on [**2183-4-28**] and E coli UTI. He got tylenol for this and
was sent to the ED at [**Hospital1 882**]. A CT scan showed colitis. He was
 transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] when the ED went off diversion.
.
In the ED he was afebrile with initially hypertensive blood
pressures that fell to the 80's systolic without intervention.
He got 5 liters of normal saline. Two peripheral IV's were
placed and he was considered for a central line but was
hemodynamically stable after this. Blood cultures were drawn and
he was given vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and flagyl. He was
clinically felt to have an infection and possible bowel
obstruction. Surgery was consulted and recommended CT scan,
which showed no colitis. The recommendation was to send stool
for C dif. In addition, plastic surgery was consulted for
decubitus ulcers and felt there was no clear evidence of
cellulitis, and recommended changing dressings twice daily.
.
He says he felt warm at [**Hospital 883**] hospital but not at the [**Hospital1 **]. He
has no complaints of abdominal pain, diarrhea, SOB, chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, chills. He wants to return to the home and
doesn't understand medically why he needs to stay here.

Pertinent Results:
CXR: Left lower lobe collapse and less severe atelectasis in the
right lower lobe are new.  Peribronchial opacification in the
suprahilar right lung could be pneumonia.  Vascular deficiency
in the upper lungs, exacerbated on the left by lower lobe
collapse, indicates emphysema.  Heart is normal size.  There is
no significant pleural effusion or other evidence of cardiac
decompensation. Intestines and the upper abdomen are moderately
to severely distended with gas.
.
Abd CT [**2183-5-2**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  No dilatation or wall thickening of colon to suggest the
presence of colitis.
2.  Cholelithiasis with a possible pericholecystic fluid.  An
ultrasound could be performed for further evaluation if there is
clinical concern for cholecystitis.
3.  Opacity at both lung bases representing consolidation versus
less likely atelectasis.
4.  Sub-5-mm non-calcified pulmonary nodules at the right lung
base.  Given the presence of calcified granulomas in the right
lung base, a followup chest CT could be performed in one year if
clinically warranted.
5.  Unchanged decubital ulcer extending to the posterior aspect
of the sacrum compared to [**2182-2-27**].
6.  Single prominent loop of small bowel in the central abdomen
with no evidence of obstruction or bowel wall thickening.
.
RUQ ultrasound:
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND:  The liver is normal in
echotexture without focal hepatic mass.  Some mild prominence of
the right intrahepatic biliary duct without overt distention.
The main portal vein is patent with appropriate hepatopetal
flow.  The common bile duct measures up to 6 mm.  The
gallbladder is moderately distended.  Some tenderness is present
about the gallbladder, more so than in adjacent areas.  There is
layering sludge within the neck of the gallbladder and multiple
large shadowing stones.  There is diffuse bladder wall
thickening with intraluminal edema in some areas with a
maximal wall thickness of up to 8 mm in the fundus.  There is
urrounding pericholecystic fluid.  No perihepatic ascites is
identified.  Limited views of the right kidney demonstrate no
hydronephrosis or calculi.
.
IMPRESSION:  High suspicion for cholecystitis. (*Note - surgery
diagrees with this interpretation on clinical grounds and
reviewed scan)

MICRO: from nursing home: sensitive to ceftriaxone, cefuroxime,
imipenem, resistant to amp, augmentin, levo, tetracycline, sulfa

Brief Hospital Course:
53 year old man presented with fever, hypotension, and abdominal
distension.  The patient was admitted to the MICU after being
briefly hypotensive in the ED.
.
#) fever, hypotension - Patient hemodynamically stable upon
admission to MICU.  Although it was concerning for sepsis, his
pressure normalized with IVF, so patient is not in septic shock.
 It was thought that he may have a component of autonomic
dysfunction as well given his paraplegia.  Cultures were sent,
and were still pending at the time of discharge.  The patient
had a slightly positive UA, and had recently been on Cefpodoxime
for UTI treatment.  Given this recent abx use, C-diff may also
be a possibility, although patient is afebrile without a
leukocytosis.  His abdominal exam is completely benign, and
imaging thought to not be consistent with active infection.  The
patient was initially continued on Vanc, Levo, and Flagyl, but
after being afebrile and hemodynamically stable x 24 hours, the
antibiotics were weaned to only coverage for the UTI.  He was
started back opn Cefpodoxime to complete a fourteen day course
which he should continue upon discharge.
.
#) Abdominal distension - He was evaluated by surgery who felt
the patient does not have an acute abdomen and does not have
acute cholecystitis, rather he has a collapsed, calcified,
uninflamed gallbladdes. Alk Phos slightly elevated but could be
from bone destruction given GGT normal.  ESR and CRP mildly
elevated, not suggestive of osteomyelitis or other significant
inflammation/infection.  The patient tolerated clears well and
was quickly advanced to a normal diet.  It was felt that he may
have c-Diff given his recent antibiotics, and a stool sample was
sent.
.
#) sacral decubitus ulcers - He was evaluated by the plastic
surgery service who  recommended wet to dry dressings.  An ESR
and CRP were mildly elevated, and the wounds were monitored and
dressed according to recommendations.  Given that the ulcers did
not probe to bone and appeared relatively clean with healthy
granulation tissue, the Vancomycin was discontinued.
.
#) Psychiatric history - The patient has a history of depression
and suicide attempts, and was continued on his home psych meds,
with no acute issues during this hospitalization.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 44 year old man who was found down and brought in by
ambulance after a poly-pharmacy overdose suicide attempt, with
his subsequent course complicated by initial respiratory failure
and intubation in the field, followed by compartment syndrome,
rhabdomyolysis, and renal failure.

The patient is 44 year old male c severe depression s/p drug
overdose suffering from rhabdo causing a resolving ARF, now
hyperCa resolving, s/p fasciotomies for compartment syndrome,
healing well.
.
#Overdose (medical issues): It was not clear exactly which drugs
the patient overdosed on.  Reportedly benzo/fiorecet/tramadol
were found. Tox screen was positive for
benzo/barbs/tylenol/methadone. After obtaining collateral info,
it appears that the pt was taking large quantities of
benzodiazepines and percocet/subuxone daily.  Tylenol level in
the ED was elevated at 5.9.  The patient was started on a NAC
protocol in ED (150mg/kg over 1hr, then 50mg/kg over 4hrs, then
100mg/kg over 16hrs).  Pt was also found to be tachycardic and
hypertensive and was started on a CIWA scale with valium for
suspected benzodiazepine withdrawal.  The patient was also
started on a fentanyl patch with taper for possible narcotic
withdrawal. He was supplemented with thiamine, folic acid,
pyridoxine.  Psychiatry was consulted and followed him
throughout the admission (see below).
.
# Severe Depression, Suicide Attempt: During much of the
admission, the patient was sleepy (early on, to the point of
ongoing sedation in the context of a fair amount of pain and
pain medication), flat of affect, and not particularly
communicative. As the admission progressed in mid-[**Month (only) **] the
patient was more awake and mildly communicative. He had poor
appetite and in the context of trying to improve his PO intake,
we started Remeron. The patient's appetite and mood appeared to
improve slightly although this was doubtlessly also associated
with resolution of some of his medical and surgical issues.
.
Mr [**Known lastname **] required a 1:1 sitter throughout much of his
admission and continued to express his concern that he would not
be safe alone without a sitter. However as he improved from a
medical standpoint, he made gradual strides in his mood and
concern for his own safety.  For the last week of his hospital
stay, he continued to state that he felt safe without 1:1
observation.  He was started on Remeron in part for appetite and
also for mood; psychiatry followed along. Per recommendation of
the psychiatry consult service, he should be followed in the
rehab facility for additional psychiatry support and medication
titration. He no longer requires a 1:1 sitter, and has been
discontinued, as per psych recs.
.
At the time of discharge, he was on Mirtrazipine 30mg PO QD and
lorazapam 1mg PO Q6H prn anxiety as per psych recs.
.
#Compartment syndrome in BLE:  Vascular surgery was consulted in
the ED and performed LLE fasciotomy in 4 compartments on night
of admission as well as a RLE fasciotomy on [**7-2**].  He received
perioperative vancomycin for prophylaxis. He developed
significant rhabdomyolysis with the CK trend detailed above in
the ""labs"" section, which was likely the major contributor to
his acute renal failure (see below). Vascular surgery continued
to follow this patient closely, with the following notable
interventions:
[**7-1**]: LLE fasciotomy in 4 compartments night of admission ([**7-1**])
[**7-2**]: RLE fasciotomy [**7-2**]
[**7-13**]: Bilateral additional lateral fasciotomies and additional
debridement.
[**7-17**]: Additional debridement, with some dead muscle seen but
appeared to be mostly well. Placement of wound vacs. Was kept
overnight in the Vascular Intensive Care Unit for monitoring for
concern for effects of reperfusion of possible necrotic tissue;
was stable overnight and transferred back to the medicine
service in the morning. He remained stable on the medical floor
thereafter.
[**7-20**]: Vac change.
[**7-24**]: Repeat vac change.
[**7-26**]: Skin grafting to all but one fasciotomy site (lateral
left).
[**8-1**]: Removal of vacs and evaluation of grafts.
[**8-2**]: Skin grafting of the remaining fasciotomy site.
All skin grafts were taken from regions of thigh skin.
He should follow-up in the vascular surgery clinic as
recommended in the discharge instructions. Wound care for the
incisions include Adapetec dressings and ACE bandages. The
incisions were clean, dry, and intact, at the time of discharge.
- Pain management has been an issue as the patient has
significant tolerance to opiates and benzos. On discharge, the
patient was on a Fentanyl 100mcg patch and Oxycodone 15mg PO
Q3H, with the patient requesting around 40mg daily and still in
visible distress upon movement.
.
- daily dressings, adaptec, ACE bandages.
-pain - the pain is well controlled at every time i ask, con't
current medications - oxycodone
-fentanyl 100mcg
-morphine was d/c'ed to reduce polypharmacy
-morphine 2mg X1 was given this morning, oxycodone 40 was taken
over the day yesterday and 20mg this morning, the PRN dose was
increased to 15mg Q3H.
.
#Acute renal failure:  Clinical course most consistent with ATN
secondary to rhabdomyolysis, possibly also with an element of
overdose drug-related injury; and dehydration likely
contributing a prerenal element. Renal was consulted and
followed closely. Mr [**Known lastname **] was on hemodialysis through [**7-27**].
He was kept on sevalamer for phosphate.  Gradually he
experienced renal recovery and no longer needed hemodialysis.
His discharge serum creatinine was 1.7. It is expected that this
may be the patient's new baseline as it is unlikely that the
patient will recovery complete renal function.
.
# Hypercalcemia: The patient developed hypercalcemia during his
period of renal recovery.  This was attributed to mobilization
of precipitated calcium salts in the inflammed muscles during
his rhabdomyolysis.  The patient received calcitonin in addition
to IV fluids and lasix.
- as per renal recs today, d/c lasix and calcitonin and to
continue fluids for one more day. ensure that cr and ca levels
are stable or dropping. reconsider lasix and fluids if cr and ca
levels being to rise.
- as the kidney function improves, the patient should be able to
independently maintain a negative fluid balance.
.
#C diff colitis: C diff B detected; enterobacter detected from a
tissue culture from a debridement; and pan-sensitive E coli was
seen in his urine on the 24th. Otherwise all of his repeated
cultures were negative. In the MICU, while febrile and critical,
he was treated with vancomycin and cefepime empirically. He was
treated empirically and perioperatively with vancomycin starting
on [**7-2**]. His E Coli was treated with ciprofloxacin from
[**Date range (1) 22999**]; this was changed to cefepime because of fever. On [**7-16**]
cefepime was changed to meropenem after his enterobacter was
detected, with concern for likelihood of development of ESBL on
a cephalosporin. Meropenem and vancomycin were discontinued on
[**7-31**]. He was on initially empiric flagyl from [**7-7**] because of
abdominal pain and loose stools in the setting of broad-spectrum
antibiotics, and now is scheduled to stop on [**8-7**] (7 days after
the discontinuation of vancomycin and meropenem). He was on and
off PO vanc; we found after several attempts that when we pulled
PO vanc he was more likely to be febrile, more likely to have an
elevated white count, and more likely to have abdominal pain;
furthermore, C diff B toxin was detected on [**7-9**] and gave
further argument for aggressive C. diff treatment. PO vanc was
stopped on [**8-7**]. At discharge, the patient had solid stools and
was afebrile.
.
The sources of his fevers were generally not clear; some may
have been secondary to tissue trauma and reperfusion, or to drug
effects. After meropenem and vancomycin were discontinued on
[**7-31**], he has had fewer fevers since.
.
#Transaminitis:  This is likely from hepatic injury from OD
including tylenol and shock liver from hypotension (it was
unclear how long the patient was down).  Hepatitis serologies
for B and C returned negative. This resolved over the earlier
part of the admission. His coags began elevating around [**7-7**] and
his INR reached a peak of 3.5; this resolved, lagging behind his
resolving liver enzymes, confirming the observation of a brief
time of liver dysfunction followed by resolution.
.
#Hypertension and tachycardia: Mr [**Known lastname **] was hypertensive
early in the admission as well as tachycardic. This was
initially thought perhaps secondary to benzo withdrawal but
continued beyond an expected course for this; pain may have been
the more significant contributor. He was started on metoprolol
which was titrated up to 75 TID. He had no ectopy. He was
normotensive with high normal heart rates on metoprolol. As his
pain resolves and his mood lightens, it will likely be useful to
titrate this down.
.
#Shock: Initially the patient was hypotensive to 60s in the ED.
This was likely secondary to dehydration--SBP came up with
IVFs--as well as ingestion of sedative agents. He was not
clearly infected. He did receive vancomycin and zosyn in ED and
vanco for prophylaxis for fasciotomy.  BCxs, UCx were all ngtd.
CXR was without infiltrate.
.
#Metabolic acidosis: Initially, AG = 27, with delta:delta about
1, suggesting pure anion gap metaboic acidosis.  This was likely
secondary to renal failure.  Osmolal gap was 3, so methanol and
ethylene glycol poisoning was felt to be unlikely.  This
resolved with aggresive IVF resuscitation with isotonic
bicarbonate.
.
#GI Bleed: Bright red blood per rectum was observed on [**7-11**] and
on [**7-13**]. GI was consulted. He had a rectal tube at the time and
subsequent clinical observations, most especially the eventual
resolution of bleeding after pulling the rectal tube on [**7-12**],
suggested that a tissue ulceration associated with the rectal
tube was most likely to be responsible. This issue has been
resolved prior to discharge.
.
#Anemia: Anemia of Chronic Disease. Most consistent with anemia
of inflammation combined with blood loss from graft sites, and
briefly from GI bleeding. He was transfused with a total of 5
units of PRBCs over the admission. He was transfused for Hct <21
or at dialysis for values close to 21. He was started on iron
supplementation and epoeitin for support of blood cell
production starting on [**8-2**].  His need for epogen would be
expected to decrease as he continues to experience renal
recovery.
- as per renal rec and iron studies Epoetin Alfa and ferritin
was d/c'ed on [**8-11**].
.
#PPX: Heparin SC. Bowel regimen as needed.
.
#FEN: From [**7-13**] to [**7-30**], he was on TPN; his ileus, sedation and
pain seemed to preclude him tolerating much PO intake.
Eventually he was able to eat more and we decreased and then
eliminated TPN. He was tolerating a full diet with supplements.
.
#SOCIAL:  Social work followed closely. Mr [**Known lastname **] wanted his
parents to be the main contacts and also decisionmakers when he
did not have the capacity to make decisions.

.
CT Neck [**5-14**]:
1. No fluid collections or abscesses are identified within the
neck. There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes.
2. Endotracheal tube cuff appears slightly overdistended, with
no adjacent pneumomediastinum.
3. Bilateral hypodense thyroid nodules, with scattered coarse
calcifications are likely benign. Thyroid ultrasound could be
performed on a nonemergent basis if clinically indicated.
.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**5-14**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism, as clinically questioned.
Enlarged pulmonary artery, compatible with pulmonary arterial
hypertension.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent airspace disease,
likely representing atelectasis.
3. Findings consistent with cirrhosis with associated
splenomegaly likely reflecting portal hypertension.
.
CT Head [**5-14**]:
No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
CXR [**5-14**]:
1. Recommend pulling the endotracheal tube at least 2 cm back.
2. Increased density of the retrocardiac space could represent
atelectasis versus underlying hiatal hernia. Clinical
correlation recommended.
.
CXR [**5-16**]:
Probable worsening of bilateral pleural effusions with new left
lower lobe opacity. Given rapidity of onset atelectasis or
aspiration pneumonitis is favored over rapid developing
pneumonia.
.
Renal US [**5-17**]:
Unremarkable evaluation of bilateral kidneys without evidence
for hydronephrosis, obstructing stone or renal mass.
.
KUB [**5-18**]:
Ascites with retained oral contrast in the distal colon and
rectum. No contrast seen corresponding to renal fossae or course
of ureters.
.
X-ray of Right shoulder ([**2137-5-19**]
FINDINGS: There is no fracture or dislocation. The glenohumeral
and acromioclavicular joints are within normal limits. The
coracoclavicular interval is appropriate. The regional soft
tissues radiographically are unremarkable. The visualized
adjacent lung is clear.
.
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of traumatic bony injury to
the shoulder. Please note, not mentioned above, there are very
tiny curvilinear opacities in the region of the greater
tuberosity which are likely due to calcific tendinitis and are
not felt to be due to acute trauma.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression/Plan: Pt is a 46 yo woman hep C, splenomegaly &
pancytopenia of unclear etiology, depression/anxiety, hx
prescription narcotic abuse who p/w acute mental status changes
intubated. She was successfully extubated on HD 2 and then
developed acute renal failure (likely contrast induced
nephropathy).

1. Altered mental status/delirium/possible benzodiazepine
overdose - Unclear etiology for this. Toxicology screen at OSH
was not done and here only positive for opiates (she was given
then in ED)She was initially intubated for airway protection,
and successfully extubated on HD#2. Pt was initially thought to
have meningitis, though an LP could not be performed. She was
initially treated with meningeal dosing abx (vancomycin and
ceftriaxone). However, exam did not support meningitis and upon
review on OMR records, patient has a history of neck pain
(tension headache). Her altered mental status was thought to
possibly be toxic metabolic in etiology or hepatic
encephalopathy secondary to her underlying cirrhosis (elevated
ammonia level on admission). Another concern was TTP in the
setting of mental status changes, renal failure, anemia, and
thrombocytopenia (see below). However, heme-onc saw pt and felt
that this was unlikely secondary to smear.  EEG showed
nonspecific mild encephalopathy.

Lactulose was started po. Panculture was negative for infection.
Additionally, question of withdrawing from substances
(clonazepam, antispasmotics, other drugs) are more likely as on
the day of the call out, pt was found to have bottles of
clonipin under her pillows; although she denies taking the
pills, she appeared very sedated and the bottles were filled on
[**2137-5-14**] (same day she was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**]), prescribed at
[**Hospital **] Hospital. Called the pharmacy who filled the
presciption [**Telephone/Fax (3) 57986**], unable to read the signature of the
prescription as it was a hand written prescription.  Called
[**Hospital **] hospital and on call psychiatrist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
[**Telephone/Fax (3) 57987**]), pt was admitted briefly (1-2 days) for GI symptoms
thought to be pancreatitis at [**Hospital1 **], and was discharged on
clonipin (2mg PO bid) as this was her outpatient medications by
one of the interns on the floor.  Because of her sedation,
benzos and dilaudid were discontinued (she was briefly kept on
CIWA scale).  Psychiatry evaluated pt, and recommended seroquel
25mg PO tid for agitation and anxiety, and continue haldol prn
for agitation.  She became more alert and less sedated after
above regimen.  Physical therapy and occupational therapy worked
with the patient, and she did well, and cleared her to go home.
Social worker were involved throughout her stay to provide
support and resources for her substance abuses.

2. Fever: Initially had fever on admission to ICU. Likely source
thought to be a new LLL pna (aspiration vs. hospital acquired).
Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and flagyl were started but d/c'd on HD
#5 as CXR improved and pneumonitis was posibble. Pancultures
were negative. Although she has ascites, she never had abdominal
pain or asterixis suggesting spontanous bacterial peritonitis.
Right shoulder xray done for pain was negative for acute
fractures.

3. Non-oliguric Acute renal failure- Creatinine rose to peak of
4.1 from 0.7. Seen by nephrology who thought it to be consistent
with a contrast induced nephropathy (ATN) given dates.
Creatinine steadily decreased to 1.6 at the time of discharge.
Cryoglobulin negative. ATN from dye is most likely.

4. s/p intubation: intubated for AMS and for ease of obtaining
imaging studies.
Extubated on HD #2.

5. Pancytopenia: Etiology was unclear and patient reports having
a bone marrow biopsy with ""inconclusive results"". HIV negative
in [**2137-2-28**]. Baseline platelets are around 55K.  She had a
brief platelet drop from her baseline, hem/onc was consulted for
concerns of TTP (given that this episode occured around same
time of her ARF).  Peripheral smear on heme review with no
evidence of hemolysis. Fibrinogen, FDP, and DAT negative per
heme recommendations. Pt received vitamin K x 3 doses po.  Her
CBC remained stable around her baseline after that.

6. Neck pain - thought to be chronic as above; Muscle relaxants
were d/c'd secondary to patients mental status and over
sedation. Dilaudid was initially continued in the MICU, but was
discontinued on the floor as pt was seen to hiding bottles of
clonipin under pillow and appear extremently sedated on the day
of the transfer to the floor.  Her mental status improved after
stopping sedating medications (narcotics, benzo, muscle
relaxants, etc).

7. [**Name (NI) 1622**] pt reports pain all over and non-localizing except for
neck pain as above.  All workup were negative.  More likely pain
seeking behavior.  Secondary to severe sedation, her muscle
relaxant and dilaudid was d/c'ed. She was kept on tylenol for
pain which she tolerated well, although she complained of pain,
but after reassurance and for her safety (not wanting her to be
oversedated), she didn't get further narcotics.

8.  Chronic Hepatitis C-  Not previously worked-up. No evidence
of  decompensation. Abdominal US in findings had evidence of
cirrhosis, no portal vein thrombosis or clot. AFP is 4.9. We
started lactulose as above.

9. Substance abuse (ETOH, opiates) - was on a CIWA which was
d/cd. Continued thiamine and folate.  [**Last Name **] problem #1 above as pt
was found to hide her clonipin bottles under her pillows, and
all sedative meds were D/C'ed given severe sedation.  Psych
recommended seroquel 25mg PO tid for agitation and anxiety w/
haldo prn.  She tolerated that regimen well.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for altered mental status, and extensive
workup for infectious causes were negative.  EEG is negative for
seizures.  You mental status has improved after you were taken
off a lot of the sedation medications, including clonopin or
other benzodiazepam, dilaudid, muscle relaxant.  Psychiatry team
evaluated you inpatient, and recommended that instead of taking
benzodiazepam (clonopin) for agitation and anxiety, try seroquel
(less sedating) as needed for your anxiety, which you were given
a presciption.  Please follow up with your PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
(see appointment time below) regarding any adjustment of your
medications from now on, as it is very important to coordinate
all of your medical care in one place.
.
Please take your medications as prescribed. Do not exceed 2grams
of tylenol every day for control of your pain.  Do not take any
NSAIDS (including ibuprofen, motrin, etc.) until your kidney
function is close to your baseline.
.
Call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room if you have
fever>101, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, severe
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea, or any other
symptoms that are concerning to you.

History of Present Illness:
38 yo M with history of HCV and heroin abuse, who collapsed
after snorting heroin. His friends, who were also using drugs,
hit him in an attempt to awaken him. They called EMS, who
reportedly arrived after 5 minutes. He was reportedly initially
not in a shockable rhythm and received 20 minutes of CPR. During
CPR, he received epinephrine 4 mg, narcan 4 mg, and 40 units of
vasopression. He was intubated by EMS.
.
He was initially brought to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital, where he was found
to be in Vfib and regained spontaneous circulation with 1 shock.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Urine tox
was positive for benzos, opioids, ethanol, marijuana.
.
In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], initial vital signs were T 32C HR 69 BP
127/66 RR 20 Sat 99%. He had no gag reflex, no reponse to
painful stimuli, pupils fixed 6 mm. GCS 3. He did overbreath the
vent. He was taken for CT, which showed extensive cerebral edema
with herniation, consistent with global hypoxic injury. After
CT, he became hypertensive to 230s/140s, and there was concern
for further herniation, but this was later felt to be secondary
to asynchrony. The patient was given vecuronium and propofol and
started on a propofol gtt, with normalization of his blood
pressure. The patient was also given mannitol 25 gm IV x 2. A
right IJ CVL was placed in the ED. A left femoral A-line was
placed due to difficulty placing a radial A-line. The patient
was noted to have copious urine and stool output.
.
Neurosurgery was consulted in the ED, and communicated that due
to the patient's extemely poor prognosis, there was no
indication for intracranial pressure monitoring.
.
Vitals at the time of transfer to were HR 105 SBP 140s. On
arrival to the MICU, the patient was unresponsive and unable to
give a history.

Brief Hospital Course:
38 yo M admitted to MICU s/p cardiac arrest in setting of drug
abuse, with head CT indicating anoxic brain injury and cerebral
edema, with signs of early hearniation.
.
# Anoxic brain injury: Head CT showed anoxic brain injury with
cerebral edema and early herniation. Neurosurgery was consulted
in the emergency department and stated that the prognosis was
very poor, with recovery highly unlikely. For this reason,
neurosurgery recommended against any neurosurgical intervention.
This prognosis was discussed with the patient's half brother and
half sister by the MICU team.
.
# s/p cardiac arrest: The patient was started on an Arctic Sun
cooling protocol.  However, after a family meeting in the MICU,
during which the patient's very poor neurologic prognosis was
explained, the family decided that it would be most consistent
with goals of care for the patient to be made comfort measures
only. At this point, the cooling protocol was stopped.
.
# Hypotension: The patient developed hypotension which was
treated with phenylephrine and IV fluids.
.
# Hyperkalemia: The patient had hyperkalemia to 6.4, which was
treated with calcium, insulin, and dextrose, with improvement in
the patient's potassium to 4.2.
.
# Heroin overdose: Narcan given prior to admission.
.
# Goals of care: The MICU team met with the patient's half
brother [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 89325**], as well as [**Name (NI) 15000**] wife.  The MICU team
also spoke with the paient's half sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 89325**] via
telephone.  [**Doctor Last Name **] and [**Doctor First Name **] explained that the patient's parents
were deceased and that the patient had no children, was never
married, had no other siblings or half siblings, and had no
other relatives.  They also explained that the patient had never
selected a healthcare proxy.  Therefore, [**Name2 (NI) **] and [**Doctor First Name **] were
determined to be the patient's next of [**Doctor First Name **].  During extensive
conversations, during which the patient's prognosis was
discussed, [**Doctor Last Name **] and [**Doctor First Name **] explained that the patient would not
want to be kept alive on life support unless there were a
reasonably good chance that he would have the ability to
function and live independently.  The MICU team explained that
given the patient's anoxic injury and cerebral edema, such a
recovery was extremely unlikely.  [**Doctor Last Name **] and [**Doctor First Name **] decided that it
would be most consistent with the patient's wishes to be made
comfort measures only, without any further life-sustaining
therapy.  The patient's vasopressors were stopped, and he was
subsequently extubated.  He died peacefully and was pronounced
dead at 3:04 a.m. on [**2169-6-28**].  The medical examiner was
[**Name (NI) 653**], and given the circumstances of the patient's cardiac
arrest, the case was accepted for review.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lethargy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 48-year-old HIV
positive African-American male with a history of
polysubstance abuse, hepatitis C, cirrhosis and hypertension
who was admitted to [**Hospital 10073**] Hospital on [**2177-2-10**], for
detox following a recent binge using crack cocaine (about one
gram per day), alcohol (one pint of wine per day) and Xanax
and Klonopin while on Methadone maintenance.  On [**2177-2-12**], he was noted to have fluctuating mental status
(somnolence, disorientation) and after being found down
beside his bed confused, with a bloody nose and a blood
pressure of 170/130, he was presumed to have had a seizure.
He was given 1 mg of Ativan and was brought to the [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Department.
Following a negative head CT, no further seizures and stable
vital signs, the patient was discharged back to Bornwood on
an Ativan taper.  On [**2177-2-13**], the patient was reported
to be lethargic and ataxic, with a blood pressure of 150/100.
EMT brought the patient back to [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department, where his vital signs included a
blood pressure of 190/90, pulse of 88 and a respiratory rate
of 4, satting 94% on room air.  The patient was barely
responsive to sternal rub, with constricted pupils and was
started on Narcan, receiving a dose of 0.06 mg/hour with good
effect.  He was admitted to the MICU in the early a.m. on
[**2177-2-14**].  It was difficult to obtain additional history
from the patient at this time.  Subsequently it was learned
that the patient received some OxyContin 40 mg from a friend
while at detox, and remembers taking it prior to admission to
the hospital, although he is unclear as to what day he took
it.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  HIV positive since [**2162-3-12**].  A CD4 count of 78 with an
undetectable viral load was noted in [**2176-9-10**] as per the
patient's primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8271**].  The
patient has a history of thrush as per previous dictation
summaries.  There is a question of a history of PCP in the
past.  The patient was on HAART, but this was discontinued in
the fall of last year because of decompensating liver disease
in the setting of hepatitis C.
2.  Multisubstance abuse including intravenous drug abuse.
The patient has a long-standing history of multisubstance
abuse going back 25 years that includes intravenous heroin
and cocaine abuse, benzodiazepine use including Xanax and
Klonopin, and ethanol.  The patient has been in and out of
rehabilitation facilities in the past, stays on long term
Methadone maintenance.  While the patient does admit to
recent use of cocaine, ethanol, and benzodiazepines, he
denies use of heroin for several months, stating that he does
not crave heroin while he is on Methadone.
3.  Hepatitis C positive.  The patient has active hepatitis C
disease with a high viral load and is not a candidate for
therapy at this time considering his current treatment for
depression.  His albumin has been as low as 2.5 in the past
but has improved since holding HAART therapy.  He has no
history of ascites or gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient
falls between Child Class B and C cirrhosis.
4.  Pan cytopenia likely secondary to HIV and ethanol abuse.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Depression.
7.  History of tuberculosis exposure.
8.  History of bacterial endocarditis, Staph positive in the
past ([**2161**] and [**2168**] hospitalizations).
9.  History of sternoclavicular septic arthritis in [**2167**].
10. Status post motor vehicle accident with head trauma.
11. Bilateral leg pain and numbness secondary to peripheral
neuropathy.
12. Status post appendectomy.
13. Status post inguinal hernia repair.
14. Question of a distant history of seizure.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:
1.  Methadone 55 mg q. day.
2.  Prozac 20 mg q. day.
3.  Ativan 1 mg t.i.d. taper.
4.  Thiamine.
5.  Folate.
6.  Clonidine 0.2 t.i.d. p.r.n.
7.  Motrin 400 mg q. 4h. p.r.n.
8.  Mylanta 30 cc q. 4h. p.r.n.
9.  Ativan 1 mg p.o. q. 4h. p.r.n.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife in
[**Location (un) 686**] and has five children and several grandchildren.
He is retired since [**2172**] after working for American Airlines
as a ramp worker.  He now lives on SSI with Mass Health and
Veterans benefits that cover his medications.  As previously
mentioned, he has an extensive history of intravenous drug
abuse that includes intravenous heroin and cocaine abuse that
extends back for decades.  His recent binge was attributed to
increased depression of recent time because of his inability
to stay clean, his cirrhosis and chronic illnesses, a recent
fight with his wife, multiple deaths in the family, and an
upcoming court date next week for a DUI that he was arrested
for in [**Month (only) 404**] of this year.  The patient has a one pack per
day smoking history and, while he denies extensive abuse of
alcohol, he does admit to recently drinking one pint or one
bottle of wine per day.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has allergy to Bactrim that causes
him to have a rash.  The patient has an allergy to nafcillin
which has also given him exfoliative dermatitis of the palms
and soles in the past.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's mother is healthy at age 83.
The patient's father is 82 years old, suffering from diabetes
mellitus.  The patient has two sisters who have died of
cancer, one at the age of 58 and one who passed away in her
20's.  There is no family history of substance abuse.  There
is a question of a history of depression in the patient's
mother.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  At admission the patient denied
complaints of headache, chest pain, shortness of breath,
nausea, vomiting, fevers or chills.  He had no complaints of
diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain at the time.  No
dysuria or increased urinary frequency.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination at presentation to the Intensive Care Unit floor
the patient had the following vital signs:  He was afebrile
with a heart rate of 75, blood pressure of 139/101, a
respiratory rate of 18 and he was saturating 100% on room
air.  General appearance:  The patient was very somnolent,
but responsive to questions and without tremulousness.  On
examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, the
patient was normocephalic, atraumatic.  Mucus membranes were
dry.  Pupils were 4 mm and reactive to light bilaterally.
The patient's neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.  On
pulmonary examination the lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally without wheezes or crackles.  On cardiovascular
examination, there was a normal rate and rhythm with normal
S1, S2.  A systolic murmur was appreciated at the apex.  On
abdominal examination normal bowel sounds were present.  The
abdomen was soft, non-tender and non-distended.  The
extremities were without edema or cyanosis.  On neurological
examination, the patient was alert and oriented times three.
Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  No focal motor
deficits were appreciated.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had
the following laboratories on admission:  A complete blood
count revealed a white blood cell count of 1.9 with an ANC of
700, hematocrit of 32.5 and a platelet count of 53,000.
Chem-7 (hemolyzed) showed a sodium of 137, potassium of 4.8,
chloride of 103, bicarbonate of 31, BUN of 13, creatinine of
0.8 and a glucose of 118.  A serum tox screen for aspirin,
ethanol, acetaminophen, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, TCA
was negative.

RADIOLOGY/STUDIES AT ADMISSION:
1.  Electrocardiogram:  Sinus rhythm, with left ventricular
hypertrophy and left atrial abnormality.  Nonspecific ST
changes were observed.  Q2 prolongation that is new on this
EKG was observed compared with previous [**2170-12-16**] EKG.
2.  Chest x-ray:  Mild to moderate cardiac enlargement with
prominent left ventricle contour.  Wide thoracic aorta.  No
evidence of pulmonary congestion or infiltrates.
3.  Head CT:  Head CT from [**2177-2-12**] Emergency Department visit
showed mild focal dilatation, with a normal ventricular
system.  No midline shift, mass, mass effect, hemorrhage was
observed.  Chronic paranasal sinus disease was noted.

IMPRESSION AT ADMISSION:  This is a 45-year-old
African-American male with a history of polysubstance abuse,
HIV and hepatitis C who came to the Emergency Department with
stuporous mental status changes from detox facility.  This
was felt to be most likely from an opiate overdose, as the
patient appeared to respond to Narcan while in the Emergency
Department.  Infection as a possible etiology for mental
status changes could not be completely ruled out in this HIV
positive patient with his last CD4 count of 78.  However, the
patient does recall taking an extra 40 mg of OxyContin prior
to admission on top of his maintenance Methadone dose of 55
mg per day and benzodiazepine taper that he had been started
on after his [**2177-2-12**] Emergency Department visit, making
overdose more likely.

HOSPITAL COURSE IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT:
[**Unit Number **].  Neurological:  Patient's mental status changes which
included increased lethargy to stuporousness, pinpoint pupils
and decreased respiratory rate in the setting of Methadone,
benzodiazepine and opiate use make opiate overdose the most
likely cause of this patient's presentation.  The patient
showed good response to naloxone throughout his stay in the
Intensive Care Unit which was continued as a drip until [**2177-2-15**], with dramatic improvement in the patient's state of
alertness.  Other causes for his change in mental status
included withdrawal from benzodiazepines and alcohol,
electrolyte abnormalities, infection, intracranial processes,
as well as renal hepatic disease.  For that reason,
electrolytes were followed, calcium, magnesium, phosphate
levels were sent.  An LP was also performed.  The patient was
pan cultured, including cultures for blood, urine and
cerebrospinal fluid.  Because of the patient's history of
alcohol and benzodiazepine use with the last alcohol use
likely on [**2177-2-10**], there was a possibility of
withdrawal in this patient, so a CIWA protocol with diazepam
q. 4h. for a score greater than 10.  Clonidine p.r.n. was
also continued for the possibility of developing opiate
withdrawal.  In this patient with depression, his Prozac was
held while he was in the Intensive Care Unit.  A Neurology
consult felt that the seizure on [**2177-2-12**], was most
likely secondary to a combination of withdrawal from both
alcohol and benzodiazepines.  As recent cocaine was evident
in the urine tox screen, there was some concern of a cerebral
infarct, but a negative CT and nonfocal neuro examination
made this less likely.  Liver function tests and ammonia were
also sent in this patient with a history of hepatitis C.

Patient's laboratory values while in the Intensive Care Unit
on [**2177-2-14**], included a calcium of 8.0, magnesium of 1.4
and a phosphate of 3.1.  The patient's PT was 13.7, INR was
1.2 and PTT was 37.7.  The patient had an elevated AST of
101, an ALT of 52, an alkaline phosphatase of 129, and a
total bilirubin of 0.8.  His albumin was 2.7 and was repeated
that same day and found to be 3.1.  Amylase was 98 and lipase
was 63.  The patient had an ammonia elevated to 95 with no
history of previous baseline ammonia recorded in the past.  A
urine tox screen was positive for cocaine and Methadone and
negative for benzodiazepines.  An LP was performed on [**2177-2-14**], which showed 0 white blood cells, 6 red blood cells,
a protein of 37, and a glucose of 57.  The Gram stain was
negative for PMNs, no microorganisms were seen.  Cryptococcal
antigen was not detected, and fluid, acid fast, viral, and
fungal cultures were sent.

2.  Infectious Disease:  This patient is HIV positive and
hepatitis C positive, and it is possible that infection could
also be an underlying cause of his mental status changes.  As
mentioned he was pan cultured, including blood, urine, CSF
and stool cultures.  Tests for CD4 count and viral load were
sent.  The patient reported that he has not been on
retrovirals since the fall of last year.  Liver function
tests were ordered to follow up the status of his cirrhosis,
and were elevated as previously mentioned in this dictation.
Throughout the patient's duration in the Intensive Care Unit,
he did not complain of fevers, shortness of breath or
productive cough, dysuria, or other complaints suggestive of
infectious process.

3.  Pulmonary:  The patient's respiratory rate improved on
Narcan drip while in the Intensive Care Unit and there was no
need to intubate.

4.  Cardiac:  The patient has a history of hypertension and
has used beta blockers in the past.  He has not been on his
hypertensive medication during the past several days while at
detox.  His pressures remained elevated while in the
Intensive Care Unit.  In the evening of [**2177-2-14**], he was
hypertensive to 206 and was given a dose of hydralazine for
control of his pressure.  Subsequently, lisinopril 5 mg q.
day and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q. day were begun to better
control his pressure.  The patient's EKG showed an increased
QT prolongation from prior EKG, in the setting of a potassium
of 3.4 upon repeat Chem-7 on [**2177-2-14**].  It was unclear
that any of the other medicines that the patient were taking
should be associated with causing this QT prolongation.  The
patient's potassium was repleted.

5.  Hematology.  The patient's pan cytopenia was noted on
CBC.  This was stable throughout his stay in the Intensive
Care Unit.

6.  Renal/Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition.  The patient
was given maintenance fluids of one-half normal saline 100 cc
per hour.  These were maintained until the patient's mental
status improved.  He began tolerating p.o.'s on [**2177-2-15**].  Because of the patient's elevated ammonia, he was
placed on a low protein diet once he was able to tolerate
p.o.'s.  Electrolytes were followed daily and were repleted
as necessary, with potassium and magnesium requiring
repletion.  The patient was placed on thiamine, folate and a
multivitamin considering the patient's history of alcohol
abuse.

7.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient has a history of cirrhosis
in the setting of HAART use that was discontinued in [**2176-9-10**] with a history of ethanol abuse.  He has had elevated
transaminases, PT and albumin of 3.1 and elevated ammonia.
Lactulose was started at 30 cc t.i.d., titrated to less than
two stools per day to treat the elevated ammonia.  Hepatitis
C serologies were not sent at this time and will likely be
followed as an outpatient.

8.  Prophylaxis.  The patient was placed on subcu heparin and
Pepcid IV q. day.

SUMMARY OF INTENSIVE CARE UNIT STAY:  The patient's mental
status continued to improve on Narcan drip which was weaned
over 12 hours to a respiratory rate greater than 11.
Cultures remained negative during the ICU stay.  The patient
was able to tolerate p.o.'s prior to transfer.  Vital signs
were stable, although his blood pressures remained elevated
prior to transfer.  The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 8559**] [**Company 191**] Service on [**2177-2-15**].

HOSPITAL COURSE ON THE FLOOR ([**2177-2-15**] to [**2177-2-17**]):
1.  Neurological:  On arrival to the floor, the patient was
breathing comfortably in no acute distress and was alert and
oriented with some depressed mood.  He did complain of some
symptoms of nausea, chills, diaphoresis, aches and pains,
diarrhea, that he thought were consistent with his typical
withdrawal symptoms.  He was continued on the CIWA protocol
with p.r.n. diazepam, and clonidine was continued for his
complaints of opiate withdrawal.  His Methadone was begun on
the floor at a dose of 55 mg q. day.  Lactulose was also
considered in light of his elevated ammonia, although
encephalopathy appeared to be unlikely in this patient with
no asterixis or additional changes in mental status.  We
continued to follow daily labs which showed a white blood
cell count of 1.7, hematocrit of 32.6 and a platelet count of
47,000, with an ANC of 740.  Electrolytes showed a sodium of
137, potassium 3.3, chloride 107, bicarbonate 22, BUN 8,
creatinine 0.5 and glucose 98.  Calcium was 7.5, magnesium
1.8 and phosphate was 3.0.  While the PT and INR were now
normal, PTT remained slightly elevated at 39.  The patient
was offered a nicotine patch for his nicotine addiction which
he declined.  The patient's mental status continued to be
stable during his stay on the floor, with no signs of overt
anxiety, hallucinations, instability, but the patient was
somewhat depressed and nervous, which he admitted was
primarily due to his worry about personal stressors.  His
symptoms of opiate withdrawal were also negligible during his
second and third days on the floor.  Prozac was restarted on
his last day of admission for depression.  It appeared that
the patient had very few symptoms of ethanol withdrawal,
however, his blood pressure did remain elevated throughout
his stay but without tachycardia.  The patient's symptoms of
opiate withdrawal seemed to be well controlled on his
Methadone maintenance dose although the patient did receive
one to two doses of benzodiazepine per day, and requested
clonidine on his final day of admission p.r.n.  However, the
patient does admit that he feels better than he has in years
physically but admits that it is psychological problems and
depression that make him feel most concerned at this time.
We had several discussions with the patient regarding the
seriousness of this hospital admission and the risk of poor
outcome if he continues such risky behaviors, as this
overdose might have been life threatening.  The patient is
actually quite thoughtful and clearly depressed with his
current health situation, living environment (""my
neighborhood is full of drugs""), and life stressors (several
deaths in the recent past in his family).

2.  Infectious Disease.  The patient's CD4 count was found to
be 48 during this admission and his viral load is still
pending.  The patient remained afebrile throughout his
admission, without complaints of fever, productive cough,
dysuria, abdominal pain, or other clinical signs concerning
for infection.  Blood, stool and cerebrospinal fluid cultures
have been negative to date.  Prophylaxis was begun for PCP
with dapsone and fluconazole was also started in this patient
with a history of thrush.  However, fluconazole was
discontinued prior to __________ as prophylaxis is not
indicated routinely in HIV positive patients.  As the
patient's CD4 count is below 50, toxoplasmosis titers were
also sent, and should be followed up for possible
toxoplasmosis prophylaxis as well as [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis as an
outpatient.

3.  Cardiovascular.  The patient's EKG was repeated on [**2177-2-16**], and was found to be unchanged from admission EKG,
with suddenly prolonged QT interval.  Potassium was also 3.2
on [**2177-2-16**], and was repleted.  The patient's blood
pressure continued to be elevated throughout his stay on the
floor, in the 150's to 180's over 90's to 100's.  The dose of
lisinopril was increased to 10 q. day, and it was decided
prior to discharge to change the patient's blood pressure
regimen to 10 mg lisinopril b.i.d., to discontinue the
hydrochlorothiazide, and to begin Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q. day.

4.  Pulmonary.  The patient was breathing comfortably with
normal respiratory rate and saturating well on room air
throughout his stay on the floor.  While the patient
complained of some runny nose on transfer to the floor, he
developed no other symptoms suggestive of a serious
respiratory infection.  This patient does have previous
hospitalizations because of pneumonia with a question of PCP
pneumonia in the past.

5.  Renal.  The patient had normal creatinine throughout his
hospital stay.  His urinalysis was negative except for a
negative urobilinogen in this patient with advanced liver
disease.  Urine culture was positive for group B Strep which
was an endogenous organism not considered needing to be
treated.

6.  Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition.  The patient's lytes
were followed and were repleted while he was on the floor.
Potassium remained slightly low throughout and was repleted
with 40 mEq of KCl during each of his stays on the floor and
was increased to 60 mEq on [**2-17**].  He was maintained on a
low protein diet in light of his elevated ammonia which was
up to 148 on his day of discharge.  He was continued on
thiamine, folate and multivitamin and additional B12 and
folate studies were sent and are still pending.  He tolerated
p.o. liquids and solids well throughout his stay on the
floor.  No complaints of nausea or vomiting.

7.  Gastrointestinal.  In this patient with hepatitis C
positive cirrhosis his albumin came back at 2.8 on [**2177-2-16**].  We continued to follow an ammonia which was 148 prior
to discharge, and lactulose was poorly tolerated by the
patient and was discontinued on his final day of admission.
The patient was requesting therapy options for his liver
disease and seemed most concern with this of his health
issues.  Unfortunately, Interferon therapy may be
contraindicated in this patient on Zoloft with clear symptoms
of depression.  As an outpatient it would be recommended that
he receive vaccination such as hepatitis A in light of his
liver disease.  While this patient has no prior history of
gastrointestinal bleed, we began Imdur for GI prophylaxis,
and it is recommended that he have an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy as an outpatient.

8.  Hematology.  The patient's pan cytopenia was stable while
on the floor.  The patient did complain of a nose bleed one
morning in the setting of low platelet count that he
described as robust, but which stopped easily and did not
recur.  In light of the patient's pan cytopenia which may be
likely due to ethanol use, HIV, liver disease, it was thought
that B12 and folate should also be checked.

9.  Prophylaxis.  The patient remained on heparin subcu
b.i.d. and ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. throughout his stay
on the floor.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was in good condition at
discharge.  He was not complaining of symptoms of alcohol
withdrawal, and was maintained on CIWA protocol greater than
8 during his last three days on the floor.  Methadone
maintenance was restarted with good effect.  He was primarily
concerned with psychosocial issues of maintaining sobriety, a
safe drug-free environment, his chronic health issues, family
stressors, and tomorrow's pending court appearance.
Depression, for these reasons, is a concern in this patient
who appears to have overdosed on narcotics leading to this
admission.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged back to
[**Hospital 10073**] Hospital, where he was first admitted last Monday
([**2177-2-10**]) to begin a detox program prior to this
hospitalization.  He wishes to return to Bornwood to continue
his detox in a safe environment where he can try to address
his recurrent urges for polydrug abuse.  [**Hospital 10073**] Hospital is
located at [**Street Address(2) 10074**] in [**Location (un) **], [**Numeric Identifier 10075**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Thiamine 100 mg q. day.
2.  Folic acid 1 mg q. day.
3.  Multivitamin.
4.  Dapsone 100 mg q. day.
5.  Methadone 55 mg q. day.
6.  Fluoxetine 20 mg q. day.
7.  _____ 10 mg b.i.d.
8.  Ativan 1 mg q. 4h. p.r.n.
9.  Clonidine 0.2 mg t.i.d. p.r.n.
10. Potassium chloride 20 mEq b.i.d.
11. Norvasc 2.5 mg p.o. q. day.
12. Magnesium oxide 400 mg p.o. q. day.
13. Imdur 30 mg q. day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS AND FOLLOW UP:
1.  The patient was instructed to call his primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8271**], after discharge to set up a
follow-up appointment in one week if he desired to continue
having her involved in his care.
2.  As the patient mentioned a desire to transfer his care
from the V.A. Hospital, as he has had some negative
experiences there in the past, we have set up an appointment
for him with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Associates, [**Hospital1 1444**], for this Thursday, [**2-20**], at 2:00 p.m., the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building.  At this
appointment the patient will be able to follow up his pending
laboratory studies which include pending cultures, his viral
load, his toxoplasmosis cultures.  Also potassium and ammonia
levels should be checked at this time.  As the patient's
blood pressures have been elevated during his hospital stay
and his blood pressure control medications are still being
optimized, his blood pressure should be checked during this
visit and modification of his medical regimen should be
considered.  Pending results of the toxoplasmosis titers, the
patient should be considered for a toxo and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis,
considering his CD4 count of 48.  Also consider a hepatitis A
vaccine and confirm hepatitis B status in this patient.  As
this patient was noted to have a slightly prolonged QT
interval on EKG, it would also be useful to recheck an EKG
during this visit.  While this patient has had no complaints
of gastrointestinal bleed in the past, he should be sent for
endoscopy to look for varices as an outpatient.  The patient
has also been requesting psychiatric and/or social work
support as he has numerous psychosocial stressors and needs a
support network to help him with his depression and with the
numerous issues involving his drug abuse and health care
problems.  This patient should also be set up to be followed
in the [**Hospital3 **].
3.  The patient was also scheduled to visit the Pain Clinic
at [**Hospital1 69**] this Thursday with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2-20**] at 12:40 p.m.  This visit is
important in light of his chronic back pain and peripheral
neuropathy, which the patient states have been a factor in
his persistent drug use.
4.  Continue with Methadone maintenance program as previous
to admission.
5.  Consider contacting [**Name (NI) 10076**] for acupuncture treatments as
the patient has requested this therapy which has worked for
him in the past.

Pertinent Results:
[**6-14**]: AXR:IMPRESSION: PD catheter with tip coiled in the pelvis.
[**6-11**]: IMPRESSION: 1. Areas of hypoattenuation in the high
bifrontal white matter, and subcortical hypoattenuation in the
left posterior temporal lobe with loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
differentiation. These findings are new from MRI brain [**12-29**], [**2140**], and could represent areas of new edema with underlying
focal lesion or possibly areas of new infarcts. An MRI head
without and with Iv conrast is recommended for further
characterization.
2. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.

[**6-11**]: PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: There has been an
interval increase in retrocardiac opacity obscuring the left
hemidiaphragm. The right lung and the left upper lung zone are
clear. The right costophrenic angle is slightly blunted,
suggesting a very small right pleural effusion. The heart is
slightly enlarged, but the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unchanged. There is no hilar enlargement. Soft tissue and bony
structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Interval increase in left basilar atelectasis with
pleural effusion. Superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Possible small right pleural effusion.

[**6-11**]: MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: INDINGS: In comparison with a prior CT of the
head, the previously described low attenuation areas in the
parietal regions appear with hyperintensity signal on the FLAIR
sequence, mildly hyperintense on the diffusion-weighted
sequence, and also slightly hyperintense on the corresponding
ADC maps, these findings are nonspecific and may represent
posterior reversible encephalopathic changes, please correlate
clinically. There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage,
hydrocephalus, or midline shift. A low-attenuation area is
identified on the right occipital region, likely consistent with
chronic deposits of hemosiderin, please correlate with the prior
MRI dated [**2140-12-28**].

IMPRESSION: Limited examination secondary to motion artifacts.
On the FLAIR sequence, there is evidence of hyperintensity areas
in the parietal regions, left occipital lobe, which are
nonspecific and may represent possible posterior reversible
encephalopathic changes. The prior low-attenuation area of the
right occipital lobe is unchanged and may represent chronic
deposits of hemosiderin. There is no evidence of hydrocephalus
or midline shifting. Followup with MRI of the head with and
without contrast under conscious sedation is recommended if
clinically warranted.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 23 F with SLE, ESRD not on HD, chronic VTE with RUE and
facial swelling p/w hypertensive emergency and delta MS
initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was on a labetalol gtt as well as home
medications.  She had head imaging (MRI) with following results;
On the FLAIR sequence, there is evidence of hyperintensity areas
in the parietal regions, left occipital lobe, which are
nonspecific and may represent possible posterior reversible
encephalopathic changes.  She was evaluated by neurology who
considered PRES, though she did not seize.  She was started on
keppra as she has had seizures before, and will follow up with
them.
.
# HTN Emergency. She has had multiple admissions in the past
with neurological involvement, hemolysis in the past. SBP >300
in ED.  Her BP was lowered slowly with a labetolol gtt in the
ICU.  When it was stably below 180 she was transferred to the
medical floor on the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**].  She was continued on
clonidine TP, po labetalol, aliskiren.  I/O goal was even.  Her
BP remained between 120-170 before discharge, she no longer had
any headaches, or nausea.  She was oriented times three.
Aliskiren was not covered by masshealth, and a prior auth was
faxed over.  A supply from the pharmacy was sought but
unavailable.  She was given a prescription for 5 pills to bridge
her to the time when the prior auth would have been approved in
order to facilitate her paying for the prescription.  She was
also given hydralazine and instructed on how to take extra doses
when her blood pressure increased.

.
# Delta MS. [**2-11**] to hypertension likely ischemic/hypertensive
changes on CT. AAO times three, no focal neurological signs
currently. Also likely component of OSA although this seems
chronic. No seizures although has had them in the past.
Neuro was consulted, and she was started on Keppra for question
of PRES, keppra for 6 weeks until f/u with neuro, has outpatient
MRI appointment as well.  They will  likely keep her on keppra
until the changes in her parietal regions have resolved.

.
#UTI-found on admission, was on Cipro-will complete course of 5
days
.
# VTE. L Brachiocephalic VTE chronic with collaterals. Also h/o
other VTE [**2-11**] to lines in the past. Currently on coumadin. INR
2.1 coumadin was held in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for anticipation of procedures.
Her coumadin was restarted, has VNA set up and will be followed
by [**Hospital3 **].
.
# Facial Swelling. Unclear etiology likely [**2-11**] to VTE in RUE
(brachiocephalic) vs. angioedema-pt now without swelling
.
# ESRD. Currently no on HD due to patient preference, awaiting
to start PD next week. Since patient has refused HD there was an
attempt to correct lytes and acid base with medications. Avoided
fluid overload with lasix, patient currently making urine. Lytes
- see below. She will commence PD as an outpatient (had issues
yesterday with catheter flushing)-still not working-will try
laxatives to relieve loops of bowel possibly wrapped around
catheter and she will follow up with renal on Monday. Her
ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] were held, renally dosed her meds, and phos binder was
administered.
.
# Metabolic Acidosis/Electrolytes abnormalities. AG 15 likely
[**2-11**] to uremia. K elevated to 5.6-6.0 however has been elevated
in the past, likely some chronic hyerkalemia. She received
kayexalate 30 mg tid until K <5
Her electrolytes stabilized and she was continued on her home
regimen of sodium bicarb (650mg two tabs daily).

.
# SLE. On prednisone chronically, likely needs PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] at some
point --Atovaquone to prevent hyperkalemia
Continued on prednisone 10mg (dropped from 15mg 2 weeks ago)
.
# Anemia-Hct and plts dropped on this admission but now stable

.
# HOCM. Avoid dehydration. Currently on Labetalol.
.
# PPX: systemically anticoagulated, getting kayexalate, PPI
# FEN: Electrolytes as above, no standing fluids I/Os goal even.

# Access: 2x PIV currently
# Code: Full
# Dispo: home

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with hypertensive emergency, your blood
pressure was extremely high.  You had a head CT and MRI that
showed some changes concerning for PRES (posterior reversible
leukoencephalopathy syndrome), and neurology recommended
initiating Keppra.  Your blood pressure was brought under
control in the intensive care unit and now you have a new
regimen of medications.  In addition peritoneal dialysis was
attempted but there were difficulties with your catheter.  This
will be further addressed by your outpatient nephrologist.  You
will continue to have your INR drawn and sent to coumadin
clinic.
You should take all your medications as prescribed, you will be
taking the keppra until you follow up with a neurologist in
approximately 6 weeks. You will also be taking the Aliskiren
following discharge.  You will be discharged on hydralazine
(which you will take three times daily EVERY DAY), as well as
when your blood pressure gets too high as follows;
if you blood pressure is above 180 please take an extra dose of
hydralazine, check your blood pressure in 10 minutes, if it is
still not take another dose and recheck your blood pressure in
another 10 minutes-if it is still elevated take another 25mg
hydralazine and recheck in 10 minutes-if it is still elevated
please call your doctor or go to the ER.
Continue taking your coumadin and having your INR sent to
coumadin clinic.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79-year-old
male with a single episode of chest pain at rest and minimal
activity who went to the emergency department and was ruled
out for a myocardial infarction by enzymes.  He followed up
with an exercise stress test and it was stopped secondary to
fatigue.  It also showed ST-segment depression in multiple
leads.  It also showed mild basilar hypokinesis of the
inferior wall and his EF was 60 percent.  He was then
referred for a cardiac catheterization, which showed 80
percent stenosis of his LAD, 70 to 80 percent stenosis of his
OM1, his left circumflex showed no apparent CAD, and his
right coronary artery had approximately 80 percent stenosis
and 70 percent mid-stenosis.  Echocardiogram revealed an EF
of 65 percent.

FAMILY HISTORY:  He does have a positive family history for
coronary artery disease.  His father died at the age of 50 of
an MI.  Multiple brothers have coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a 5 feet 5 inches male, 161
pounds.  His vital signs were temperature 97.3 degrees, blood
pressure of 140/70, pulse of 73, respirations 18, and he was
94 percent on room air.  He was alert and oriented x3, and
appropriately following commands.  His lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  His heart rate was regular rate
and rhythm.  No murmurs, clicks, rubs, or gallops.  His
carotids revealed no bruits.  His abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  His
extremities were well perfused.  No clubbing, cyanosis,
edema, or varicosities.  His radial pulses bilaterally were 2
plus.  His PT and DP distal pulses were 2 plus bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  On [**2188-10-24**], a chest x-ray showed no
cardiopulmonary abnormality; his UA was negative; his white
blood cell count was 7.2, hematocrit of 37, and platelets of
142,000.  His sodium was 138, potassium 3.8, chloride 106,
bicarbonate 22.  BUN 20, creatinine 1.1, glucose of 96.  His
PT was 13.2, PTT 26.1, INR 1.1.  ALT 21, AST 22, amylase 54,
total bilirubin 0.7, and albumin 3.9.  His hemoglobin A1c was
5.6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2188-11-6**], the patient was taken to the
operating room and underwent coronary artery bypass graft
operation x4.  The grafts were as follows:  LIMA to LAD, vein
to RCA, vein to OM1, and vein to diagonal.  Bypass time was
103 minutes, cross clamp time was 85 minutes.  The operation
went well.  The patient was in good condition and transferred
to the CSRU.  His drips were as follows:  Propofol at 30
mcg/kg/minute, Neo-Synephrine at 0.6 mcg/kg/minute.  His
heart rate was 90 beats per minute, A paced.  His mean
arterial pressure was 70, CVP of 7, PA diastolic of 8, and PA
mean of 15.

On postoperative day one, the patient was successfully
extubated.  His blood gas revealed metabolic and respiratory
acidosis and patient received one unit of bicarbonate.
Physical examination revealed a patient in no acute distress
with a heart rate that was regular in rhythm with no murmurs.
His lungs were clear to auscultation.  His vital signs were
as follows:  95 in sinus rhythm, blood pressure 129/59, he
was at 85 percent saturation.  The patient was attempted to
receive BIPAP.  His chest tubes put out 500.  His JP in his
leg for the saphenectomy put out 50.  His urine output was
300.  The plan on postoperative day one was to discontinue
his Swan, give Lasix 20 mg b.i.d., start Lopressor at 12.5 mg
b.i.d., try to get the patient out of bed, and have Physical
Therapy see the patient.

On [**2188-11-8**], which was postoperative day two, the patient was
in stable condition with a T-max of 96.5 degrees, 110/60
blood pressure, and heart rate of 87.  He was saturating at
94 percent on 2 liters of O2 via nasal cannula.  His chest
tubes put out 310 and his JP was 50.  The patient's physical
examination was unremarkable.  His orders were to discontinue
his chest tubes.  Also note, this day is the first day the
patient was on Far 2 regular telemetry floor.  He was
transferred from CSRU on [**2188-11-7**] to Far 2.

On postoperative day three, which was [**2188-11-9**], the patient
was in stable condition.  His physical examination was
unremarkable.  His blood pressure was 115/64.  He was 96
percent on 3 liters.  The patient, overnight, went into
atrial fibrillation.  He was started on amiodarone and his
Lopressor was increased.  The patient's current heart rate is
in normal sinus on this day after the start of the
medication.

On postoperative day four, the patient received one unit of
packed red blood cells, late yesterday, [**2188-11-9**], for a
hematocrit of 24.  He did not go back in any atrial
fibrillation rhythm.  Since early yesterday, he was draining
some old blood from his saphenectomy in his right leg.  Vital
signs were as follows:  T-max 99.4 degrees, pulse 64 in sinus
rhythm, blood pressure of 130/70, input and output 1200 and
2100.  The patient was alert and oriented x3.  The rest of
his physical examination revealed clear lungs bilaterally;
regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs; bowel sounds were
positive; abdomen that was soft, nontender and nondistended.
His extremities were nonedematous.  His sternum was clear,
dry, and intact; no erythema, no drainage.  His right lower
extremity had some drainage of old blood from the JP drain.

The patient was discharged on [**2188-11-10**].  He was in stable
condition and discharged to home with services.

Chief Complaint:
chest pain and Signs of alcohol withdrawal

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
On presentation to the medical ICU:

62 y/o male w/ Medical history of untreated Hep C, COPD, chronic
alcholism, HTN, CAD s/p MI in [**3-/2116**] w/ stenting who presents
with chest pain and withdrawal. The patient has had multiple
admissions most recently 2 in [**Month (only) 216**]  [**2116**]. In [**3-/2116**] he had an
NSTEMI with stent placement. In [**6-/2116**] he had a stress MIBI with
a wall motion abnormality and small,  reversible, anterolateral
perfusion defect. In [**7-24**], he was r/o for MI with enzymes,
EKGs. Cardiac cath was not recommended.  Pt was to be optimized
on medications, but continues to drink to excess and not take
cardiac medications. He was also found to have depression and
alcohol withdrawal and was encouraged to go into therapy, but
declined last minute.  He was readmitted from [**Date range (1) 45402**] for
chest pain again where cath was deferred given his continued
drinking and non-compliance with medications.
.
The patient presented again to the ED on the day of admission
with chest pain and concern over his drinking.  He reports that
he lost his health insurance and so has not been able to take
his medications for the past 3-5 days (was taking half pills
prior to that).  This made him anxious so he started drinking
more than usual.  He reports usually drinking 1 quart of vodka
daily, with his last drink being yesterday.  He has chest pain
2-3x daily for which he usually sits down and rests, which
dissipates his pain.  The patient also had a fall a few days
prior from a sitting position where he fell forwards and hit his
nose on a table, denied LOC, loss of bowel/bladder function,
tongue biting.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  98.0 110 154/114 18 100% 15L nrb.
Labs showed bicarb of 12 with anion gap of 26, normal CBC,
lipase of 93, EtOH of 69, normal LFTs, and trop < 0.01.  He was
given 3L NS, plavix 75mg, metoprolol tartrate 100mg, and a total
of ativan 8mg IV for withdrawal.  Per ED report, did have
hallucinations.  On transfer vitals were 90 185/115 RR: 30 O2:
99%RA
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient states he is feeling better
than on admission.

untreated Hepatitis C, COPD, alcoholism, HTN, anxiety presents
with chest pain and in alcohol withdrawal. He has been admitted
12 times this year, numerous times for chest pain, most recently
twice in [**2116-8-24**].  His last admission was for chest pain;
he was considered for catheterization but decision was made at
that time to hold off due to his medication noncompliance and
continued alcohol abuse. He has been getting chest pain at rest
as well as with minimal exertion (walking [**11-12**] feet), which
subsides with rest.  He reports history of hallucinations with
previous alcohol withdrawal but denies prior seizures.  However
he did fall from seated position into a table and sustained a
nasal laceration, but denied LOC, urinary incontinence.
.
He presented to the ED on [**2116-11-7**] with chest pain and anxiety.
He stated that he had not been taking his medications since he
recently lost his Mass Health insurance.  He stated that his
lack of insurance and inability to take his medications made him
anxious, so he consumed roughly 1 quart of alcohol per day which
seemed to ease his anxiety.
.
In the ED, his initial VS were: 98.0 110 154/114 18 100% 15L on
NRB. CE's negative, EtOH: 69, bicarbonate: 12, anion gap: 26,
lipase: 93. He was given 3L NS, plavix 75mg, metoprolol tartrate
100mg, and 8mg of IV ativan for  ithdrawal.
.
He was transferred to the MICU for stabilization, where he has
placed on the CIWA scale and given 50mg valium overnight and
10mg during the day on [**2116-11-7**].  He was also given isosorbide
with improvement in his hypertension and tylenol for his
headaches. He [**Date Range 20003**] out for MI with enzymes negative x3 and EKG
has been unchanged.
.
He was then transferred to the floor. Before transfer out, he
complained of chest pain, shortness of [**Date Range 1440**], and weakness.
EKG was performed which showed evidence of old infarct but no
acute changes. He was given Valium and by re-evaluation was
sleeping and when awoken had no complaints of pain.
.
ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena,

atelectasis. No interval development of pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is seen.  Hyperinflation is appreciated better on
the lateral views.


Brief Hospital Course:
62 y/o w/ PMHx untreated Hep C, COPD, chronic alcholism, HTN,
s/p NSTEMI in [**3-/2116**] with BMS to proximal LAD who presents with
chest pain, found to be in alcoholic hallucinosis, now treated
for alcohol withdrawal.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES THIS ADMISSION:
# Alcoholic hallucinosis - Patient is unsure if he has ever
seized before.  Looking through past [**Hospital1 18**] admits, he has had
hallucinations before, but no documented seizures.  He reported
not drinking since 1 day prior to admission ([**2116-11-5**]).   He
was started on an aggressive CIWA scale for valium 10mg PO q1hr
prn.  He was started on thiamine, folate, and MVI supplements.
He was weaned off the CIWA scale after several days without
issue and hallucinosis resolved, he appeared less tremulous, and
overall was feeling much better. He was extensively counseled
regarding his alcohol abuse, and encouraged to get back to AA.
He will be discharged to a rehab facility where he can continue
sobriety and try to get back on his feet.
.
# Angina - Patient has had repeated admissions over past few
months for chest pain, most recently twice in [**2116-8-24**].
Decision was made not to recath at that time as patient has not
been compliant with his medications and was felt that cath would
bring more harm than benefit.  Had intermittent symptoms of
[**2115-1-27**] chest pain, often sharp and midline, throughout his
hospitalization and was seen to have EKG's unchanged from prior,
and pt had [**Date Range 20003**] out for MI with cardiac enzymes. His chest pain
was likely related to his anxiety but possibly from hypetension
as well, for which his Imdur was increased to 90 mg daily. He
was restarted on his home cardiac regimen that he should have
been taking including ASA, Plavix, statin, [**Last Name (un) **], beta blocker,
Imdur. Should he continue to have chest pain at the rehab, would
give sublingual nitroglycerins, check blood pressure and if
elevated consider giving an extra Metoprolol; also consider
relaxation techniques given self reported anxiety.
.
# Shortness of [**Last Name (un) 1440**]: As above, likely a large component of
anxiety; however pt also with COPD at baseline. His CXR appeared
unchanged and consistent with COPD.
.
# Hypertension - Was hypertensive in ED, likely secondary to
withdrawal as well as rebound from beta-blocker and nitrate
therapy.  The patient antihypertensives were restarted on
admission (see above).  His Imdur was increased from 60mg to
90mg per day. His blood pressure should be followed up and
consider titrating his medications; his Valsartan could
potentially be uptitrated. He also needs to quit drinking
alcohol which will likely benefit his blood pressure.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# COPD - Had distant [**Last Name (un) 1440**] sounds and tachypneic on admission
but was later saturating well on RA by the time of discharge. He
was started on standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs with
albuterol prn and was intermittently complaining of shortness of
[**Last Name (un) 1440**] especially on exertion, which was improved by rest and
nebulizer treatments.
# Anxiety - pt self reported severe GAD and this was likely the
cause of his intermittent mild chest pain and shortness of
[**Last Name (un) 1440**]. Initiation of an SSRI was discussed but not able to be
fully explored before discharge, as this would require close
outpatient follow up which was not able to be secured by
discharge.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-*patient may be a candidate for anti-depressant or anti-anxiety
treatment, which may help with his medication compliance, severe
anxiety, and alcoholism*
- continue working with community social worker and
rehabilitation facility to continue abstaining from alcohol,
continue to encourage alcohol abstinence and compliance with AA

A brief verbal signout was given to the [**Hospital3 2558**] about the
pt's course and active issues just before discharge.

Of note, it was learned after pt was discharged that he was seen
to be drinking mouthwash in the bathroom. Our hospital mouthwash
is reportedly non-alcoholic.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Dyspnea: Pt's dypsnea improved on admission to the ED prior to
HD. Based on her imaging studies her dyspnea was likely related
to fluid overload (pt missed 2 weeks of dialysis) and her level
of anemia. Upon transfer to the floor she was continued on her
dialysis regimen and discharged on room air.

# Anemia: Pt's baseline 1 month ago noted to be low 30s, since
then her Hct has trended down to 22 several week prior to
admission. As she missed dialysis she was not able to reserve
her Eopgen which likely complicated her anemia. Pt underwent
hemolysis workup in the ICU which was ultimately negative. She
was given several units of PRBC and bumped her Hct
appropriately. She was noted to be guaiac negative on
examination.

# Hypertension: Pt was initially admitted with hypertension.
Following transition to the floor she was placed on her home
regimen. She was noted to be hypotensive in dialysis which is
likely due to her being on Labetalol, Nitro gtt on dialysis. Pt
was discharged on her home BP regimen with follow up with her
nephrologist.

# Chronic Abdominal Pain: Pt had noted some intermittent
abdominal pain which has been chronic. Lipases were noted to be
mildl elevated however no other concerning physical exam signs
of pancreatitis. Pt was able to tolerate a PO diet prior to her
discharge. Pt was continued on her outpatient regimen of
Dilaudid, Fentanyl patch, Neurontin.

# GE junction Ulcer: Pt was continued on her PPI regimen [**Hospital1 **].

# SLE: Pt was continued on her home regimen of Prednisone 4mg
daily

# History of DVT: Pt had a sub-therapeutic INR on admission. She
was discharged on Warfarin 3mg daily.

# ESRD on HD: Pt was admitted for dyspnea in the setting of
missing 2 weeks of HD. The renal team followed Ms. [**Known lastname **] during
her hospitalization and she was continued on her outpatient
regimen of hemodialysis. Pt was continued on Sevelamer and
Epogen.

# Seizure D/O: Pt was continued on her home regimen of keppra.

# Depression: Pt was continued on her home regimen of Celexa.

IMAGING
CXR [**2121-12-26**]:
IMPRESSION: Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in appropriate
position as
detailed above. Very limited evaluation of the lungs given the
profoundly low lung volumes. There is, however, extensive patchy
opacity at the left lung and aspiration versus pneumonia is
highly likely.
.
CT head w/o contrast [**2121-12-26**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. Nasal secretions
likely related
to intubated status.
.
RUQ ultrasound [**2121-12-26**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhotic liver. Previously seen liver cyst and enhancing
lesions are not identified on the current study.
2. Patent main portal vein.
3. Stable splenomegaly.
4. Stable thickening of the gallbladder wall, likely secondary
to hyperproteinemic state.

Brief Hospital Course:
56 y/o M with HCV cirrhosis with portal hypertension, portal
hypertensive gastropathy, ascites with recurrent paracenteses
(last [**12-10**]) and encephalopathy transferred from an OSH with
altered mental status and intubated for airway protection.
.
#Altered Mental status- Given the patient's history hepatic
encephalopathy is the most probable cause. The differential of
this acute encephalopathy includes infection, drug overdose, or
GI bleeding.The patient currently has no signs of GI bleeding.
The patient has been afebrile and currently has no leukocytosis.
On OSH records the patient had a UA indicating a UTI, however on
the UA we obtained the results did not indicate a active UTI.
The patient also has been taking increasing amounts oxycodone in
the last week which is a possible etiology causing his acute
hepatic encephalopathy. He also has evidence of left lung field
opacities which are consistent with pneumonia or aspiration.
Therefore it could have been the patient developed a pneumonia
in the last few days as an outpatient or aspirated recently
given his altered mental status and intubation. He was started
empirically on levofloxacin for PNA this was discontinued after
6 days for pancytopenia. Sputum cx negative. CT head was
negative for acute bleed or stroke and no history consistent
with seizure like activity.  All sedative drugs were stopped. He
was stabilized in the MICU and extubated w/o complication, and
transferred to the general liver wards.
He noted to have mild flap on transfer. Patient received a
diagnostic paracentesis to assess for SBP which was negative.
Lactulose and rifaximin restarted. Urine and blood cx negative.
MS continued to improve w lactulose and he reached MS baseline
on the day after transfer out of the MICU with noted resolution
of asterixis at that time as well.
.
#Respiratory Status - The patient was on assist control on
transfer and recently transitioned to pressure support with a
stable ABG after. Will ensure the patient is ventilating
appropiately by following his minute ventilation . Will attempt
to wean off the propofol to assess his mental status more
appropiately. He was extubated successfully on [**12-27**]. Pt was
comfortable on room air at time of transfer to general floor.
.
#Pneumonia- Has X ray evidence with left lung field opacities,
though no leukocytosis or fevers. Could be community acquired or
aspiration as etiology. He was covered w levofloxacin for
empiric pna on [**12-26**] and this antibiotic was discontinued after
6 days for negative sputum, blood, and urine cultures. He also
was asymptomatic. Pt developed  pancytopenia 4 days after
initiation of levofloxacin.
.
#Thrombocytopenia- According to our records the patient's
platelet count is typically between 50-100. Platelet count noted
to downtrend 2 days after initiating levofloxacin. He did not
require transfusion of platelets. Would expect resolution of
suppression w abstinence from antibiotics. Plan to monitor on
outpt setting w labs after discharge. Pt was informed to seek
medical attention if febrile, or active bleeding.
.
#Anemia- According to the patient's history he has a microcytic
anemia, and currently is consistent with baseline hematocrit. On
admission pt had no active signs of gastrointestinal bleeding.
He was guaiac negative on general floors. Pancytopenia developed
on [**12-28**] and pt noted to have downtrending Hct [**3-11**] suppression
from levofloxacin. He was transfused 2units of packed RBCs
during his stay w/o any sign of active bleeding. Hct stable at
time of discharge.
.
#Cirrhosis- On admission, this pt was on the transplant list
however given his recent drug use/oxycodone abuse, it was
decided to inactive him  at the Tuesday transplant meeting on
[**2121-12-30**]. Pt and family was notified. Pt scheduled for outpt
therapeutic paracentesis in next 2 weeks after discharge. RUQ
u/s shows patency and moderate ascites. No para indicated given
no interval increase in abd girth or ascites and poor amt of
fluid available on [**12-10**] outpt attempt at para.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Acute increase from baseline 1.2 to 1.7 on [**12-30**]
attributed to diuretics, poor po intake prior to admission.
Diuretics were held and he was administered volume challenge
with albumin dosed 1gm/kg x 2 days and 75g x 1 day. Creatinine
downtrended close to baseline at time of discharge. Plan to
follow up at clinic appt. Diuretics were held and plan to assess
and restart at appt f/u w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] in 2 weeks.
.
#Substance abuse: Pt admits to abuse of oxycodone prior to
admission. Social work consulted on admission and provided
resources for follow up and referral to transplant psychiatry.
Opioids, narcotics, and benzodiazepines were avoided during his
stay. He was discharged on a temporary amount of seroquel per
inpt psychiatry recommendation prn insomnia. He was advised to
follow up with outpt PCP for assessment and discussion about
further sleep aides. Was advised to avoid any potentially
addictive medications. Consider antidepressant as outpt.

CXR: [**2142-8-28**]
AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Severe cardiomegaly is stable. There are
bilateral hazy perihilar opacities with mild upper zone vascular
redistribution compatible with mild pulmonary edema, worse in
the interval. Small left pleural effusion is stable. There is a
retrocardiac opacity, likely representing atelectasis.  No
pneumothorax is visualized. The osseous structures are
unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema, slightly worse compared to
prior.
.
ECHO [**2142-8-29**]: The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is severe symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regiona/global systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. There is a small circumferential
pericardial effusion without evidence for hemodynamic
compromise.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-8-13**], the
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher and the
pericardial effusion is minimally larger.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
25F with SLE since age 16, ESRD on HD, malignant HTN, and h/o
PRES, admitted with HTN urgency and dyspnea, probable volume
overload.

# Dyspnea: On admission was thought secondary to volume overload
given exam and CXR consistent with increased pulmonary vascular
congestion. Less likely to be infiltrate lack of radiographic
infiltrate, leukocytosis, or increased sputum production, so
antibiotics were not continued. Pt has small cardiac effusion
likely chronic serositis?????? may be contributing to dyspnea and
resulting in a restrictive physiology. She received a repeat
ECHO showed only a mild enlargement of this effusion (no
tamponade) and there were no concerning EKG changes.  She was
treated with [**Year (4 digits) 2286**] and was transferred to the floor in stable
condition.

Unfortunately on [**2142-8-30**] while in the [**Date Range 2286**] unit pt became
hypotensive with SBP in 60s. Pt was given 2L NS boluses without
significant improvement in SBP.  She was drowsy but able to
converse.  EKG showed sinus rhythm.  During the 3rd L of fluid,
pt became unresponsive and appeared to be having respiratory
distress.  A Code Blue was called at that point and when a pulse
was checked, it was absent.  Resuscitation efforts for PEA
arrest were initiated.  She underwent a prolonged code with
appropriate interventions for PEA arrest; due to concern for
possible PE (she had known SVC thrombosis and had not been
anticoag due to noncompliance), she even received TPA.
Unfortunately, all efforts to resuscitate the patient were
unsuccessful.  Her mother who is a [**Hospital1 18**] employee was contact[**Name (NI) **]
in the beginning of the code and was able to be present with her
several times during the resuscitation.  She received emotional
support from our social worker, several [**Name (NI) 10945**] nurses, as well as
her work colleagues.

Her mother did agree to an autopsy evaluation, results pending.

Her nephrologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4883**] was notified of her death by one
of his colleagues.

Brief Hospital Course:
Following intubation, the patient became hypotensive; he
required treatment with pressors after IV fluids failed to raise
his BP.  He received solumedrol as a treatment for COPD
exacerbation.  He was started on a course of levofloxacin,
ceftriaxone, and vancomycin for presumed septic shock.  A head
CT was negative.  Also, he ruled out for both an MI and PE.  His
variable blood glucose was managed with an insulin drip, and his
mental status improved.
The patient??????s chest CT scan showed RUL and LLL consolidation
consistent with infection.  Also, a rounded density was present
anterior to the anterior
segmental branch of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery,
representing
either an area of atelectasis/consolidation or a mass lesion.
(Follow up chest CT is recommended.)  He was switched to
antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and Zosyn for a possible
aspiration PNA on [**12-13**].  His sputum, urine, and sacral wounds
were all cultured, with the following results:
[**12-13**] Blood cx: diptheroids [**1-19**]; Staph coag negative [**2-19**].
[**12-14**] U cx contaminated; sputum gram-stain consistent with oral
flora, cxgrows rare yeast and negative for Legionella; wound
swabs rare growth of GNRs, diptheroids, Pseudomonas, both coag
positive and negative Staph, probable enterococcus, Proteus.
He was extubated on [**12-16**] and transferred to the medicine
service.
The patient had a mild tremor while in the ICU and was seen by
neurology when he reached the medicine service, who diagnosed
him with a physiologic, non-Parkinsonian tremor most likely
secondary to albuterol or steroids.  The patient was also seen
by a speech and swallow consult, who cleared him for a full
diet.
The patient was weaned off his oxygen requirement over 3 days
without difficulty.  His IV antibiotics were transitioned to PO
levofloxacin, and he continued a steroid taper for his COPD
exacerbation.  Of note, the patient's HCT was noted to range
between 24 and 27 on the floor, a marked decrease from 42 on
admission.  His stools were guiac negative, and iron studies
were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  He had no clear
source for any bleeding.  The patient received 1U of blood the
day before discharge and had a stable HCT at 27 on the day of
discharge.
Throughout his hospital stay, the patient's sacral ulcers were
followed by plastic surgery.  The patient will follow up with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of plastic surgery as an outpatient.  Of note, a blood
cx from [**12-17**] is still PND.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 30864**] is a 29-year-old female
with a past medical history significant for significant asthma
requiring four intubations, bipolar disorder, and intravenous
drug abuse (on methadone) who presented to the [**Hospital1 346**] on her usual state of health until the
date of admission when she was found by Emergency Medical Service
to be lethargic and nodding off on the street.  She was
unresponsive until she received one mg of Narcan and 100%
nonrebreather. The patient reports taking her albuterol meter-
dosed inhaler one day prior to admission as well as on the date
of admission without effect and her usual dose of methadone.

While in the Emergency Department, she received a further dose of
Narcan, as well as 120 mg of Solu-Medrol, magnesium sulfate, and
albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.  Oxygen saturations were
maintained at 100% on 100% nonrebreather. She was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit Service for further evaluation of her
asthma exacerbation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Asthma requiring intubations times four.
2.  Bipolar disorder.
3.  Intravenous drug abuse, on methadone.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications were Neurontin,
albuterol meter-dosed inhaler, Atrovent meter-dosed inhaler,
Seroquel, and methadone.

ALLERGIES:  Allergies are RISPERDAL.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  A history of intravenous drug use; she
denies current use.  She lives with her mother.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  She was afebrile,
heart rate of 106, blood pressure of 123/76, respiratory rate
of 32, oxygen saturation of 99% on 100% nonrebreather.  In
general, she was tachypneic, uncomfortable-appearing, white
female in obvious respiratory distress.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat showed normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pupils
were equal and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements were
intact.  Sclerae were anicteric.  Mucous membranes were
moist.  Pulmonary examination showed diffuse wheezing,
rhonchi audible without stethoscope.  Stridor was obvious.
Cardiovascular examination revealed she was tachycardic and
with muffled heart sounds (difficult to appreciate heart
sounds secondary to loud breathing).  Her abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended, obese, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities showed 2+ pulses in the upper and lower
extremities.  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Good capillary
refill.  Neurologic examination showed somnolent, but capable
of answering questions, alert and oriented times three;
otherwise intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed a white blood cell count of 9.3, hematocrit of 35.5,
platelets of 264 (70% neutrophils, 19% lymphocytes, 5%
monocytes, 6 eosinophils).  INR of 1, PTT of 27.8.  Sodium
of 138, potassium of 4.1, chloride of 98, bicarbonate of 32,
blood urea nitrogen of 6, creatinine of 0.7, glucose of 105.
Human chorionic gonadotropin negative.  Toxicology screen was
negative for aspirin, alcohol, Tylenol, benzodiazepines,
barbiturates, tricyclics.  Patchy opacities bilaterally,
atelectasis at the lung bases bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:   A 29-year-old female who was
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for asthma
exacerbation.  She was initially maintained on 100%
nonrebreather as well as albuterol and Atrovent and was given
intravenous Solu-Medrol.

1.  PULMONARY:  The patient received albuterol and Atrovent
meter-dosed inhalers and intravenous Solu-Medrol 80 q.8h.

On her first hospital day she was intubated overnight with
arterial blood gases showing increased CO2.  On the second
Medical Intensive Care Unit day, the patient was extubated at 11
a.m.   Post extubation arterial blood gas was 7.38/45/136.  The
patient's respiratory status remained tenuous for several days.
On the fourth hospital day, she was still requiring almost
contiunous nebulizers.

On the fifth hospital day the patient was transferred to the
floor given her stabilized respiratory status.  At this point,
she continued to be maintained on a Solu-Medrol taper as well as
albuterol, Flovent, Atrovent meter-dosed inhalers, and Singulair.
During this time, her sputum culture grew out Staphylococcus
aureus sensitive to levofloxacin.  The patient was started on a
course of levofloxacin.  On [**12-1**] (which was the fifth
hospital day), the patient had previously been treated with
zithromycin and vancomycin, but these were discontinued on that
day ([**12-1**]).

On the seventh hospital day ([**12-3**]), the patient's peak
flow was 300 which was at her baseline.  The patient was
discharged on albuterol and Atrovent meter-dosed inhaler, Solu-
Medrol meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs b.i.d. as well as Singulair
and Flovent 220 2 puffs b.i.d.  She was also given a nebulizer
machine which she had lost.

2.  PSYCHIATRY:  The patient with a history of substance abuse
and bipolar disorder and was maintained on Serzone, Seroquel and
methadone while in the hospital.  She was followed by the
psychiatric team who recommended increasing her Serzone while she
was here.

3.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient was found to have a decreased
thyroid-stimulating hormone, T3, and free T4, as well as
irregular menses, and occasional blurry vision.  A prolactin
level was checked and was found to be mildly elevated at 27.  An
magnetic resonance imaging of the sella showed significant
narrowing in the left parietal cortex suspicious for ischemic
changes, two tiny depressions in sellar four suggestive of
adenoma, but no definite adenoma seen.  The patient's primary
care physician was made aware of this and will follow up with
her as an outpatient.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Prednisone taper.
2.  Methadone 50 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Flovent 220-mcg 2 puffs b.i.d.
4.  Singulair.
5.  Solu-Medrol meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs b.i.d.
6.  Neurontin 600 mg p.o. t.i.d.
7.  Seroquel 100 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Serzone 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9.  Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d. (day [**4-27**]).

She was discharged with a nebulizer machine as well as a peak
flow meter and told to follow her peak flow, to keep it between
300 and 350.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient's discharge status was to home
with primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 4939**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Severe asthma.
2.  Bipolar disorder.
3.  Opiate addiction.
4.  Hypothyroidism.
5.  Question of panhypopituitarism.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53-year-old
gentleman with a history of substance abuse with cervical
degenerative joint disease and lumbar surgery for low back
pain who now presents to the Emergency Room after developing
neck pain for three days prior to admission, more left-sided
than right-sided.  He states that there has been a stabbing-
like pain, an electric shock pain in that region and this
radiates down his back to the level of his buttocks.  His
shoulders and arms to a lesser extent.  His forearms have
been painful as well.  He also states that he has some
numbness across the shoulder blades as well.  Denies fever or
chills.  Has had some difficulty walking due to the pain.
Has not had bowel or bladder incontinence.  Denies recent
intravenous drug abuse.  Did drink two beers the morning of
admission.  He had otherwise been sober for the last 11
months.  Somewhat inattentive and is unable to tell complete
details of his past medical history.

Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur, rub or gallop and no
carotid bruits.  His abdomen is soft, non-tender, obese,
midline scar.  Extremities:  No pedal edema and no rashes.
Skull and spine:  Neck movements are severely limited by
pain.  He has electric shock-like sensation whenever he moves
his neck and cannot lay his head flat.  His paraspinal
tissues are tender all the way down but less towards the
lumbar region.  Mental status:  The patient is inattentive,
oriented to [**2125-1-23**], [**Hospital6 1129**].
Language is intact and naming, repetition and comprehension.
Cranial nerves:  Visual acuity is intact.  His visual fields
are full.  His optic discs are normal.  Eye movements are
normal.  His pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
His sensation on the face is intact to light touch and
pinprick.  Facial movements are normal and symmetric.
Hearing is intact to finger rub.  He has no nystagmus.  The
palate elevates midline.  The tongue protrudes in the midline
and is normal in appearance.  The sternocleidomastoid and
trapezius muscles are strong bilaterally.  He is unable to
abduct his shoulder.  Motor strength:  His deltoid are 2

wrist extension 4 plus, finger extension 4 plus, finger
flexion [**5-27**], IP [**5-27**], hamstrings [**4-27**], quads [**5-27**], AT 5/5,
gastroc [**5-27**].  Wrist extension and finger extension are give-
way.  The tone is increased in the lower extremities.  There
are no adventitious movements.  There is no ataxia or rapid
finger tapping or foot tapping.  Reflexes:  Deep tendon
reflexes are all present, brisk in the triceps and biceps and
brachioradialis with spread to the fingers.  There is no
[**Doctor Last Name 937**] reflex.  The patella and Achilles are two plus.
There are no crossed adductor reflexes.  The toes are upgoing
bilaterally.  Sensation is intact to light touch but
decreased to pin all across the back up to and including the
shoulders but preserved on the front starting at the inguinal
region.  Temperature appears intact throughout the trunk and
extremities with the exception of stocking distribution to
the knees.  Joint position is slightly impaired.  Gait and
stance:  The patient is able to walk but is wide-based and
hesitant due to pain.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was evaluated in the Emergency
Room by the Neurology Service and Neurosurgery Service.
Neurosurgery recommended a stat MRI scan and, due the
patient's continued problems with pain and some agitation, he
was medicated with Ativan and Dilaudid.  The patient was
taken down to the MRI scan and while in MRI scan the patient
had a cardiac arrest and went into PA.  The patient was
resuscitated and was brought to the Intensive Care Unit after
being intubated.

On admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient
was intubated and was not responding to commands.  His pupils
were equal, round and reactive to light.  The patient also
began to have progressive neurologic deterioration while in
the Emergency Room becoming weaker in all four extremities.
The patient was started on a Solu-Medrol protocol as soon as
this deterioration was noted and the patient did eventually
have an MRI scan.  MRI scan which was done showed a C4 to T5
epidural enhancing lesion consistent with epidural abscess
with intrinsic spinal stenosis in the upper levels.  Abscess
maximal at the T1 to T2 level with intrinsic core T2 signal
changes at C4.  The patient was taken emergently to the
Operating Room for decompression of his cervical and thoracic
spine.  He was started on empiric antibiotic coverage of
vancomycin, gentamicin and ceftazidine on admission.  He also
had a CT of the neck on admission which showed evidence of
infection or inflammation within the soft tissue of the neck.
The left-sided swelling with muscular striatum as well as
edematous fat planes extending to prevertebral soft tissue
with no frank fluid collection on CT.  Cultures from the
Operating Room debridement and decompression showed Gram
positive cocci in pairs and clusters on Gram stain.  Culture
was pending.  Blood cultures from the 16th grew out
Staphylococcus aureus and the patient spiked to 102.  On [**2144-7-10**], the patient was opening his eyes.  The patient was
not following commands.  He had some slight withdrawal in his
lower extremities and no movement of his upper extremities.
Head CT was also performed which showed no infarct or
hemorrhage.  The patient had a transesophageal echocardiogram
done on [**7-10**] that showed no vegetation with a normal
echocardiogram study.

Infectious Disease continued to follow the patient.  There
was concern for a retropharyngeal fluid collection which was
not decompressed at the time of the original surgery.
However, on subsequent MRI scans the fluid collection did not
require drainage.

On the 19th he was able to open his eyes spontaneously.
Still not following commands.  His pupils were 1.5 down to 1
mm.  Slight grimace to stimulation.  Slight withdrawal of his
lower extremities.  Right upper with no movement or grimace.
He was neurologically unchanged.  The patient had repeat MRI
scan of the cervical spine on [**2144-7-10**], which showed
evidence of T2 signal change in the C4 to C5 area of the
spinal cord consistent with possible infarct of the cord and
continued probable osteomyelitis at the C5 vertebral body.
Continued IC and antibiotics were recommended.  The patient
also had a chest CT on [**7-10**].  We had multiple cavernous
lesions which were suggestive of septic emboli.  Head CT
again showed no evidence of hemorrhage or infarct.  The
patient's cultures came back as MSSA Staphylococcus aureus
and the patient was switched to oxacillin for antibiotic
coverage.  The patient's neurologic status continued to
remain unchanged and the patient was awake but not following
commands and had no movement of his upper or lower
extremities.  Due to his lack of ability to follow commands,
an MRI of his head was obtained to rule out infarct.  His
head MRI was negative.  The MRI of his spine showed continued
paraspinal fluid collection on the right side but no further
drainage of that was done during his hospitalization.  The
patient had difficulty with desaturations on the ventilator
and was becoming more difficult to ventilate.  He had a CTA
which was negative for emboli.  Chest x-ray showed a left
lower lobe pneumonia.

A family meeting was held on [**2144-7-16**], and patient was
at this point still not following commands.  His eyes were
open but would not track or follow any commands or recognize
faces and still had no movement of any of his extremities.
The family was told of his likely poor prognosis and
discussion was had about making the patient comfort measures
only.  The family was considering those options but wanted to
wait a couple more days to see if the patient's condition
changed.

On [**2144-7-17**], his neurologic status did begin to improve.
He did begin to track with his eyes and a question of whether
he was starting to follow commands.  He was still at this
time a DNR/DNI.  On [**2144-7-20**], there was definite
improvement in neurologic status.  The patient was able to
nod appropriately to questions and follow commands by
blinking.  A meeting was held with the family again and the
family opted to move forward with trach and PEG and
rehabilitation placement.

The patient continued to have on and off spikes in
temperatures, continued on oxacillin.  On [**7-20**] he was day
six of 18 and levofloxacin was day six of 23.  He did have
positive blood cultures, one out of four bottles on [**7-17**]
that grew out Gram positive cocci.  Left lower lobe
consolidations consistent with Klebsiella though Infectious
Disease feels that this is colonization and not active
infection.  A repeat MRI of the neck on [**2144-7-23**], showed
decreased retropharyngeal edema and no fluid.  There was
still question of posterior soft tissue infection.  The
patient had trach placed on [**2144-7-24**], without
complication.  The patient was unable to have PEG placement
due to previous gastric bypass surgery.  The patient had a
Dobbhoff tube placed.

A Speech and Swallow evaluation on [**2144-7-30**], revealed
that the patient could tolerate soft solids with thickened
liquids and, therefore, a feeding tube would no longer be
necessary.

The patient's neurologic status remained stable with
improvement in right upper extremity movement at the deltoid
and withdrawal to stimulation in the lower extremities and
definitely awake, alert and following commands at this point.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 45 yo M with h/o polysubstance abuse admitted with EtOH
intoxication.
.
1.)  EtOH Intoxication with EtOH level of 317: The patient
presented acutely intoxicated and was showing early evidence of
tremulousness suspicious for alcohol withdrawal.  As the patient
has a history consistent with very high risk for severe delerium
tremens, he received a benzodiazepine load with valium and
ativan.  He received a total of 350 mg of valium and 24 mg of
ativan while in the ICU.  His vital signs remained stable
without evidence of autonomic instability.  He received IVF with
folate/thiamin/multivitamins. In collaboration with the
psychiatry consult service, he was started on a low dose
methadone taper to manage symptoms of opiate withdrawal as his
dilated pupils were more consistent with this withdrawal
syndrome as well.  He was recommended to be transferred directly
to an inpatient detox program at the [**Hospital1 1474**] VA.  However, he
decided that he would leave against medical advice and pursue a
detox program on his own.  It was explained to him multiple
times by ICU staff, psychiatry staff, and social work staff that
this was not in keeping with sound medical care as the health
care staff was concerned that he would simply resume drinking
upon leaving the hospital.  Furthermore, he was reminded that if
he left, he would be homeless as there was no time to arrange
housing.  He proceeded with leaving AMA.
.
2.) Depression with SI. He initially stated that he was trying
to kill himself.  He was placed on a 1:1 supervision while he
was intoxicated.  Upon becoming sober, he denied suicidal
ideation.  The psychiatry consult evaluated him and confirmed
that the patient was not actively suicidal.  He continued to
receive lexapro at low dose.
.
3.) Atypical muscular skeletal movements:  The patient had
periodic episodes of arm and leg moving.  These were evaluated
by the neurology consult and thought to be not consistent with
seizure and a low probability for a positive EEG.  No
anti-convulsants were indicated.

4.) Chest pain:  The patient had a brief episode of chest pain
in the left side of his chest.  This was not associated with
diaphoresis or shortness of breath.  An EKG showed no evidence
of myocardial ischemia and he had 3 sets of negative cardiac
enzymes.  Upon discharge, it was recommended that he take a baby
aspirin daily for primary cardiac prevention.

.
5.) Leukocytosis (WBC 14) likely stress response. No evidence of
infection. The white count resolved on follow-up.
.
6.) Anemia: The patient had a normocytic anemia.  This developed
after fluid resusistation.  There was no evidence of acute blood
loss.  Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic
disease.  The anemia could not be completely evaluated as the
patient left AMA.  The anemia should be further evaluated as an
outpatient.
.

7.) FEN. The patient received IVF with Thiamine, Folate, MVI in
1L of normal saline daily for 2 days. Replete lytes prn. Once he
was sober, he tolerated a regular diet.

8.) Heme positive stool. Iron studies were not consistent with
iron deficiency. Will need [**Hospital1 3782**] workup for occult blood loss.
.
9.) PPX. SC heparin, H2 blocker while not taking po's
.
10.) Code: Full
.
11.) Access: PIV
.
12.) Dispo: patient left against medical advice. psychiatry
consult confirmed that patient had capacity to make medical
decisions once he was sober.
.
13.) Communication: Sister - [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3003**] is health care proxy.

were not related to seizure activity.  The brief episode of
chest pain was evaluated as well and there was no evidence of
heart damage.
.
It is essential that you attend the recommended alcohol detox
program.  Your drinking is very detrimental to your health and
persistant drinking will very likely ultimately kill you.
.
You were given medications to manage the alcohol withdrawal
symptoms and a short course of methadone to manage opiate
withdrawal.  These medications were not continued once you left
the hospital.

ADDENDUM:  In discussion with Ms. [**Known lastname 9206**] family on [**2149-6-1**]; the decision was made to change the goals of care
to insure the patient's comfort.  As her prognosis was grave
secondary to fulminant hepatic failure, further aggressive
treatments were no longer pursued and withdrawn.

The patient was placed on a morphine drip and remained
sedated with a propofol drip on mechanical ventilatory
support.  The patient remained comfortable with her family;
including her daughter ([**Name (NI) 769**]) and her father [**Name (NI) 255**] at

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 36 yo m w/ history of IV drug use, recent heroin
use, found down, low respiratory rate in ED, improved w/ narcan.
.
1) heroin overdose-
Pt was administered narcan in the ED with immediate response.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further observation,
monitoring of vital signs.  He was maintained on a narcan drip
which was titrated off.  The pt's vital signs remained stable
with good oxygenation.  On arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was mentating
normally, appropriate in conversation.  No suspicion for
infectious etiologies (i.e. meningitis- elev wbcc likely [**3-4**]
demargination).  A social work consult was placed and psychiatry
evaluated the patient as well.  He was discharged from the ICU
in stable condition.
.
2) Hepatitis c- little history known by patient
LFTs were checked to rule out a hepatic component to his change
in mental status.  He had only mildly elevated AST and ALT, with
a normal total bilirubin.
.
3) [**Name (NI) 20191**] unclear etiology. It was not documented if pt
received D50 on presentation to ED.  However, his glucose was
elevated on both his chem 7 and urine.  An AM fasting glucose
was checked, and it was within normal limits.  His HgbA1C was
normal.
.
4) Elevated anion gap- mild at 15, then closed.  This was
thought likely secondary to ketones if patient was down for some
time (although not noted in urine). Also concern for ingestion,
although patient denies.  The gap was re-checked on AM labs and
was normal.
.
5) Depression- We continued his prozac.  Psychiatry was involved
in the care of this pt.  He will need to follow up as an
outpatient.
.
6) Benzodiazepine use-
He did not require a CIWA scale after he was titrated off narcan
gtt.

after admission for abdominal pain, MSSA bacteremia, paroxysmal
hypertension and ESRD line, presents with central crampy
abdominal pain, chest discomfort, SOB, HTN to 230s. Pt states
that at around 11pm last night developed shortness of breath
that felt as though someone was sitting on her chest. She states
that she feels as though she cannot catch her breath. Pt also
describes chest discomfort which she states that she has not had
before. She also has her chronic abdominal pain. She states that
it comes and goes and is unchanged from her baseline.
.
In the ED, initial vitals: 98.9 [**Telephone/Fax (3) 43508**]4 100%RA. SBP as
high as 241 recorded. She received Labetalol 20 IV x 2 without
improvement. She was given hydral 20 IV without improvement, so
she was placed on a Labetalol gtt @ 4 mg/min with improvement of
SBP 220. She was given IV Zofran, IV dilaudid, Hydralazine 50mg
po, Labetolol 200mg po, Labetolol 100mg IV x 3, Levofloxacin
750mg IV, Ceftriaxone 1g IV, Vancomycin 1g IV, weregiven for
question of infiltrate on CXR prior to CT. Nitroprusside gtt
added and .5 mg/kg, pressure initially improved to 180s. Tried
to wean off the nitroprusside and pressure went back up to 208.
Chest pain has resolved, still SOB with abdominal pain. Pan-scan
w/o contrast showed interval worsening of chronic pulmonary
edema. Pleural and pericardial effusions stable. Ativan seemed
to help symptoms.

One blood culture was sent in the ED. Per report, EKG showed
LVH, ST depression in V6. Trop a little more elevated than
normal but CKs flat. [**Telephone/Fax (3) **] was discussed with renal and it
was not felt that HTN is a volume issue so no need for emergent

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 24 y.o F with SLE, ESRD on HD and malignant
hypertension
 presenting with abd pain, diarrhea, and HTN.
.
# Hypertension: The patient had very high blood pressures on
presentation (200's/100's) that nevertheless are within levels
she's certainly reached during previous admissions. Initial
attempts were made to control her BP with hydralazine and
labetalol IV but after these failed to control her blood
pressure, she was started on a labetalol and nitroprusside drip
and admitted to the ICU.  This was then changed to a nicardipine
drip. She was successfully transitioned to home medications of
clonidine, labetalol, aliskiren, nifedipine and hydralazine on
[**3-22**] and transferred to the medicine floor. The next day, her BP
remained within goal of 120's/80's. She was dialyzed and sent
home.
.
Tachypnea/Shortness of breath - On admission, likely due to
pulmonary edema, however, cannot rule out cardiac etiology in
setting of small enzyme leak. Has OSA. CE's were cycled and were
negative. CPAP was continued as tolerated at home settings. SOB
resolved after HD on [**2142-3-21**]
.
# abdominal pain: Consistent with patient's baseline chronic
abdominal pain. Medication effect also possible. CT prelim neg
for small bowel obstruction. LFTs doubled from [**2142-3-18**].  On
arrival to the floor, abd pain was back to baseline and well
controlled on Dilaudid 2mg PO q 4hrs
.
# ESRD: Renal followed. HD given [**3-21**] and [**3-23**]
.
# Coagulopathy: patient on lifetime anticoagulation for hx of
multiple thrombotic events.  Continued coumadin
.
# HOCM: evidence of myocardial hypertrophy on Echo. Currently
not symptomatic.  Continued labetalol.

53 yo m with h/o AVR secondary to staph endocarditis,
polysubstance abuse, Hep C cirrohis, DM2, obesity,
hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation transferred to [**Hospital1 **]
following asystolic arrest at [**Hospital1 1474**] ER. Earlier in the
morning around 6AM he awoke and told his wife that he was not
feeling well, was having chest pain and anxiety, and wanted to
call EMS to take him to the hospital. He was brought to the ED
in good condition, requested to go to the restroom to urinate,
walked back to the bed, was placed on telemetry, and became
bradycardic. Immediatly, he had an asystolic arrest at 8:07 AM,
CPR was initiated, he was intubated and recieved epinephrine,
atropine, Narcan, vecuronium, and Ativan. He regained a
perfusing rhythm at 8:16 AM. EGK done right after this showed V1
and V2 St elevations with ST depressions in V4 - V6. He was
started on heparin, given an ASA per NGT, and medflighted to [**Hospital1 **]
for urgent cardiac cathertization.

He entered the cath [**Hospital1 **] at 11:49AM. The cathertization revealed
coronary arteries without signficant athroscherotic disease and
no interveanable lesion. Hemodynamic analysis in the [**Hospital1 **] were:
wedge 48, RA 30, RV 77/16, PA 60, CP 3.8, CI 1.7 and low paO2 pn
100% FiO2 and Peep 10. IABP placed to assist in afterload
reduction, though no hypotension present. Intra-cath echo
revealed very poor LV fxn, ejection fraction of 20%, with mod MR
and mild AI. In the cath [**Hospital1 **] he recieved 80mg IV lasix.

Past Medical History:
1. Polysubstance abuse: Long history of heroin and cocaine abuse
currently taking methadone from a methadone clinic.  His wife
says has not used illicit drugs for quite some time though
occasionally takes illicit Klonapin.

F and I

PORTABLE AP CHEST: An endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are
in satisfactory position. A swan ganz catheter is present, and
is coiling in the region of the right atrium. The cardiac
silhouette is enlarged, and there is evidence of congestive
heart failure with vascular engorgement, perihilar haziness, and
bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. No
pneumothorax is identified on this supine study.
Note is made of previous aortic valve replacement.

IMPRESSION

1. Coiling of swan ganz catheter in the right atrial region, as
discussed
with the clinical service caring for the patient.

2. Congestive heart failure.

Cardiac cath:
COMMENTS:     1.  Selective coronary angiography revealed a
left-dominant system.  The LMCA was angiographically normal.
The LAD
had a 30% mid-vessel lesion.  The LCx was dominant and without
flow
limiting stenoses.  The RCA had no angiographic evidence of
disease.
2.  Left ventriculography was deferred.
3.  Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left and
right-sided
filling pressures (RA mean 29mHg, RVEDP 28mmHg, PCWP mean
46mmHg).  The
calculated cardiac index was 1.71 l/min/m2.  These findings were

consistant with cardiogenic shock.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.

CT Head:
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass
effect, shift of the normally midline structures or
hydrocephalus. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter differentiation is grossly
preserved. Osseous structures are unremarkable. There is
aerosolized fluid within maxillary and sphenoid sinuses and
ethmoid air cells.

IMPRESSION

1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or edema.
2. Polynasal sinus disease.

TEE:

IMPRESSION

1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or edema.
2. Polynasal sinus disease.

EEG:
FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: At 5 uV of sensitivity, a low voltage, [**2-5**] Hz
delta
frequency background was seen. With auditory and noxious
stimulation,
no change in the background was evident. At one point in the
tracing,
a burst of central [**10-14**] Hz alpha frequency activity was seen
that
appeared to be artifactual in nature. Replacement of the T1
electrode
appeared to correct this finding.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed as the patient was
unable to
cooperate.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed as the
test was
requested to be done portably.
SLEEP: There were no normal sleep or wake transitions seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Revealed a generally regular rhythm of
approximately
72 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This EEG is consistent with a severe encephalopathy
of
toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology. No evidence of ongoing
seizures
was seen.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

HISTORY: A 53-year-old man with cirrhosis admitted after
asystolic arrest.
Evaluate of ascites.

Ultrasound examination of the right upper quadrant, right lower

IMPRESSION: No ascites.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Congestive heart failure/CAD: When the patient was admitted,
he was taken directly to the cath [**Hospital **] as it was thought that he
was having a large MI. His cath did not show significant disease
or thrombus.  However, in the cath [**Hospital **], his wedge pressure was
markedly elevated to 50 with an EF that was 20%, dropped from
55% on an echo in [**Month (only) 116**]. His depressed cardiac function, elevated
troponins and Ck's, and EKG changes were thought to be due to a
stunned myocardium from the resuscitation. In the cath [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
IABP was placed due difficulty oxygenating though he had a
normal SBP. He was aggressively diuresed with Lasix and Natrecor
during the first 2 days of his stay and he was nearly 5.6 liters
negative which improved his oxygenation.  The balloon pump was
removed on [**12-24**]. At that time, since he was persistently
febrile and a large amount of insensible losses, further
diuresis was held.

2. Asystolic arrest - The patient had an asystolic arrest at the
OSH of unclear etiology. Since the patient has a history of
polysubstance abuse and suicide, overdose leading to coronary
spasm was high on the differential. However, his wife denied
that the patient had been using any illicit drugs and the
patient's urine and blood toxicology screen was negative (with
the exception of benzos which he received at the outside
hospital). There was also concern for new endocarditis related
abscess affecting his conduction system given that he had an
elevated white count, left shift, and was febrile. This was
investigated and can be found below. PE was also entertained,
however the patient had a high wedge pressure which is
inconsistent with PE and he was placed on heparin for his IABP
anyway.

3. Fever/ID: The patient was persistently febrile to 104 - 105
despite cooling blankets, Tylenol, and Motrin. This was felt to
be due to infection, medications, withdrawal, or most likely,
hypothalamic dysfunction from anoxic brain injury. The patient
was taken off of all unnecessary medications. He was maintained
on his equivalent methadone dose with fentanyl.  Since the
patient had had a history of bacterial endocarditis it was
thought that he could have had a recurrence with an abscess
affecting his conduction system given his high white count, left
shift, and persistent febrile state. Blood cultures were
obtained and were negative. TEE performed and revealed no
valvular abnormalities and his AVR was in good position. A head
CT was preformed which showed a sinus infection. A sinus
aspirate was sent and was positive for Gram negative rods and
yeast. Infectious disease consult was obtained. An LP was
preformed and revealed no evidence of infection and cultures all
fungal cultures were negative. An abdominal US was preformed to
look for ascites causing SBP and the US was negative for free
fluid. The patient was maintained on broad spectrum antibiotics
throughout his stay and never broke his fever.

4. Neurology: When the patient was admitted, he had been sedated
earlier int he morning from the outside hospital code. He was
not reactive to sternal rub and did not have a corneal reflex. A
head CT was obtained which did not show any abnormalities.
Neurology was consulted for his mental status and recommended an
LP which showed increased WBC though cultures, including viral,
were negative. Also, an EEG was done which showed severe
encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology. Sedating
medication were kept to a minimum so as not to cloud neurology
exam and only maintaince opioids were given to prevent
withdrawal. On [**12-25**], the patient had a seizure which terminated
with IV Ativan. Following the seizure, he was loaded with
dilantin and had no further. He had a head MRI in the morning of
[**12-26**] which was read as diffuse anoxic brain injury and signs of
watershed infarcts. It was felt at this time that the patient in
fact did have anoxic brain injury which occurred during his
cardiac arrest.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated at [**Hospital1 1474**] ED
during the code. Following diuresis, he oxygenation improved. He
was tried on PS and did well, however, his mental status
precluded extubation;

5. DM: He was placed on an insulin drip.

6. Polysubstance abuse/anxiety/depression: Story not likely
indicative of overdose given timeline and negative tox screen.
He was placed on fentanyl to prevent opioid withdrawal and
continued on sertraline and buspar.

8. Communication: The medical team was had daily communication
with the patient's wife and kept he updated on significant
events. Prior to the patient's death, the patient's wife
expressed understanding of the patient's grave condition and
brain injury.

9. Patient's death: On [**12-26**] at 10pm the patient became
hypotensive and had a PEA arrest. Rescsutation was initiated
with chest compressions, atropine, 3 shocks, epi, and
amiodarone. However the patient entered asystole and the code
was called after 15 - 20 minutes of resuscitative efforts.  The
attending and the patient's wife was notified immediately.

History of Present Illness:
33 y/o male with PMH significant for AVR, NIDDM, h/o
polysubstance abuse, initially admitted to OSH on [**2200-3-25**] for s/p
tonic-clonic seizure resulting in a fall and broke right hip
requiring R hip ORIF on [**2200-3-31**]. It was felt that seizure was
secondary to benzo withdrawal as pt was taking 5 mg of Xanax tid
at home. He was then to d/c'd to transitional care rehab on
[**2200-4-2**] to be later admitted on [**2200-4-3**] for AMS/seizures.
In the ED at OSH, loaded with 1 gm dilantin, 2 mg ativan, and 2
mg dilaudid and admitted. Per records, pt not on benzos while at
rehab. EEG from [**4-4**] and [**4-5**] showed no localizing seizure
activity.
On [**2200-4-6**], pt became lethargic, tachypneic w/rr in 40's and
hypoxic. He was also reportedly febrile (unknown temp). He
received one dose of CTX which resulted in a skin rash. He was
then transferred to the ICU with concerns for NMS vs. sertonin
syndrome vs. benzo-withdrawal vs. infection/sepsis.
ICU course at OSH notable for start of ativan gtt and
psychotropic meds, including risperdal, seroquel, wellbutrin,
and xanaflex. WBC count at 11, Cr 4.4, LFTs wnl at that time.
Dilantin level 7.7 at that time. Daily head CT's from [**4-4**] to
[**4-6**] were all normal. During this time, pt became hyperkalemic
to 5.4 and acidotic with bicarb of 18. ABG on [**2200-4-6**] was
7.2/24/72/16. Pt was then started on a bicarb gtt. Lactate was
1.2, serum and urine tox unremarkable except for benzos. Pt was
ROMI with enzymes during his course. TTE today showed preserved
EF, moderate AS/AI, moderate MR, elevated RV pressures of 91.

IMAGING:
[**4-7**] CXR on admission: No evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
.
[**4-8**] Renal U/S: 1. Left renal cortical scarring.
2. No evidence of mass, hydronephrosis or calculus within either
kidney.
3. Normal renal vascular flow.
.
[**4-9**] Hip Films: 1. No evidence of hardware fracture, or fracture
of the right pelvis or right femur.
2. Benign-appearing lucency of the left femoral neck as
described above.
.
[**4-9**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] The aortic root is mildly
dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch
is mildly dilated. A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The transaortic gradient is probably mildly elevated
for this type of prosthesis (although some elevation is expected
in the presence of tachycardia). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet
is eccentric. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2194-5-27**], the aortic valve gradient is similar.
Mitral regurgitation may now be slightly more prominent.
.
[**4-10**] Hip Films: There has been placement of a bipolar
hemiarthroplasty within the right hip. There are no signs for
hardware complications. No bony fractures are identified. There
is a lateral surgical skin staples seen.
.
[**4-10**] EEG: Mildly abnormal EEG in the waking and drowsy states
due to
the mild slowing of the background with occasional bursts of
generalized
slowing. This suggests a mild encephalopathy although some
background
frequencies were normal. Medications, metabolic disturbances,
and
infection are among the most common causes. There were no focal
abnormalities or epileptiform features. A tachycardia was noted.

.
[**4-14**] Difficult Crossmatch: DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND
RECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has newly identified red cell
alloantibodies, anti-Cw and anti-Jkb, as well as a previously
identified, anti-E. All of these antibodies can cause hemolytic
transfusion reactions. E and Cw are members of the Rh blood
group system while Jkb is a member of the Kidd blood group
system. In the future he should receive red cells that are Jkb,
E, and Cw negative.
.
[**4-16**] Hip Films: A single frontal radiograph of the right hip
demonstrates the patient to be status post right hip
hemiarthroplasty. The stem of the femoral component projects
over the center of the medullary canal of the proximal femur.
Surgical staples project over the lateral right hip. No discrete
fracture is evident. Tubing overlying the right hip may
represent a surgical drain.
.
[**4-16**] TEE: The left atrium is normal in size. No mass or thrombus
is seen in the right atrium or right atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is moderate global
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The ascending,
transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter
and free of atherosclerotic plaque. A bileaflet aortic valve
prosthesis is present. A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The aortic prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
valve abscess is seen. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic regurgitation may
be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is a probable vegetation
on the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric. There is no
pericardial effusion.
PERFOERATED ANTERIOR MITRAL LEAFLET (A2) scallop.
***Please note that this echo report was re-read, and it was
felt that there was NO vegetation.
.
CXR [**2200-4-25**]: SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Patient is status post
median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.  Cardiac and
mediastinal contours are normal.  The right PICC has been
removed.  The lungs are clear and the pulmonary vascularity is
normal.  There are no effusions or pneumothorax.  Osseous
structures are normal.
IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia.
.
CXR [**2200-4-28**]: FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a
right-sided PICC line with the tip malpositioned in the right
neck.  The patient is again noted be status post aortic valve
replacement.  The lungs remain clear.  No effusion or
pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION:  Malpositioned right PICC line.
Results were discussed with the IV access team immediately
following
completion of the study.
.
CXR [**2200-4-30**]: COMMENTS:  Portable supine AP radiograph of the
chest is reviewed, and compared to the previous study of [**4-28**], [**2199**].
The tip of the left-sided PICC line is identified at cavoatrial
junction.
The lungs are clear.  The heart and mediastinum are within
normal limits.  The patient has prior AVR and median sternotomy.

The right costophrenic angle is not included in the radiograph.
.
[**2200-5-19**]: AP pelvis: A right hip prosthesis is present, with
methyl methacrylate surrounding the metallic femoral head
component. This femoral head prosthesis is dislocated superiorly
from the acetabulum. The acetabulum is enlarged, of abnormal
morphology, with loss of the cortical rim superolaterally and
may be paretially resorbed. There is heterotopic ossification
about the dislocated proximal femur. The femoral prosthesis
remains seated within the shaft of the proximal femur. Allowing
for osteopenia, no definite loosening is identified. The
remainder of the pelvic girdle is within normal limits.

IMPRESSION: Dislocation of right femoral prosthesis from
acetabulum. ? acetabular debridement or resorption.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial on admission,
secondary to polypharmacy, benzodiazepine withdrawal, seizure,
uremia. There was no evidence of NMS during this hospital
course.  The patient had been on an ativan gtt at the time of
transfer from the OSH, and was noted to be somnolent.  When the
ativan gtt was discontinued his mental status gradually
improved.  He was initially kept on a CIWA scale for
benzodiazepine withdrawal, but he required little valium and
this was discontinued after a few days.  As noted in the HPI,
the patient had had seizures in the setting of benzodiazepine
withdrawal.  He was initially treated with dilantin at the OSH,
but this was not continued as benzo withdrawal was considered to
be the cause of the seizures.  Patient was insisted on being
treated with demerol for pain despite seizure risk. Several
discussions were had regarding this. He receieved up to 400 mg
IV demerol per days which he tolerated well and had no further
evidence of seizure activity.
.
# ARF: Cr 5.8 on admission from baseline 4. The etiology of the
patient's chronic renal insufficiency was not entirely clear.
On admission, the patient was felt to by hypovolemic, with
pre-renal etiology of his acute on chronic renal failure.  Renal
ultrasound revealed no hydronephrosis.  Creatinine improved
somewhat with hydration.  There was no acute indication for
hemodialysis.  At times the patient became somewhat hyperkalemic
to the mid-5's, which responded to kayexelate, but this was also
felt to be realted to .  His creatinine remained stable at 2.6
by discharge but exhibited variation from day to day up to 3.5
for unclear reasons. Patient continued to make adequate amounts
of urine.
.
# Septic Arthritis of the Hip/infectious disease: The patient
had fever to 104F at the OSH, with no clear source initially.
He sustained a complex femoral neck fracture, which was managed
with a hemiarthroplasty at an outside hospital. He now presented
to the [**Hospital1 69**] with a large buttock
hematoma and evidence of bacteremia with continued hip pain. The
patient has been taken to operating room on [**2200-4-11**] for
debridement and wound cultures which revelaed enterococcus, coag
negatve staph and CORYNEBACTERIUM. He returned to the OR on [**4-16**]
for washout and hip spacer placement and a wound vac was placed.
He returned to OR on [**4-23**] for washout and wound closure. He was
noted to have serosanguinous drainage from the wound site, and a
hematoma at the site.  He again returned to the OR on [**2200-5-8**],
where he was found to have an infected hematoma in the R hip
surgical site.  The hip was washed out and cultures sent, which
grew e.coli, enterococcus and coag negative staph and a wound
vac was replaced and was changed Q3-4 days.  The patient also
had enterococcus in a urine culture and coag negative staph from
2/4 bottles of a set of blood cultures and from the tip of a
PICC line which was removed early in the hospital course. An ID
consult was obtained and the patient was started on cipro,
vanco, flagyl.   TTE and TEE were done to evaluate his valves in
the setting of bacteremia (see below).  These studies were read
as having a question of mitral valve vegetation, as well as old
mitral valve perforation, but no involvement of the prosthetic
aortic valve was noted.  AP of the pelvis was obtained on [**5-19**]
because his hip was internally rotated and films revleaed
dislocation so he was taken back to the OR for relocation on [**5-22**]
at which time his spacer was removed, washed and replaced and a
wound vac was left in place.  Subsequent wound culture taken on
[**5-26**] grew sparse E.coli, interterminent sensitivity to Cipro.
ID felt that this was the same organism previously ([**5-8**])
cultured from his hip, now with resisence to cipro.  Therefore
his abx regimen was changed from Cipro to Unasyn, but day one of
abx treatment will remain [**2200-5-8**], the day of removal of
infected hematoma.  He should complete a 6 week course of ABX
from then-(Vancomycin 1gm IV Q24H, Ampicillin-Sulbactam 3 gm IV
Q8H, and Metronidazole 500 mg PO TID)needing 19 additional days
after discharge.  After this course is completed, he will have a
one month waiting period without antibiotics to see if the
infection has actually cleared.  Orthopedic Surgery will see him
at the end of this month, and will do a hip aspirate to eval for
infection.  If his wound has closed, he is afebrile, and his
aspirate is clear of bacteria, he will have his hip hardware
replaced and should not require antibiotics afterwards. He will
need Q3-4 day wound vac dressing changes at rehab. He will
additionally follow up with infectious disease for antibiotic
management. He will need Q 3day labs including Chem10, and
PTT/INR and weekly LFTs while on antibiotics.

# Pain: The patient complained of continual severe hip pain
throughout his hospital course, and he made frequent and
repeated requests for increasing doses of pain medications.  He
has a history of polysubstance abuse, making the management of
his pain more complicated.  The pain management service was
consulted, and many different regimens were tried to control his
pain, including morphine and dilaudid PCA, increasing doses of
methadone, lidocaine patch, fentanyl patch, and the addition at
various times of neurontin, topamax, and muscle relaxants to his
regimen. At the time of discharge, his pain was controlled with
a regimen of Methadone 80mg PO four times a day, Dilaudid IV PCA
with 0.37mg given every 6 minutes with no basal rate, Morphine
Sulfate 15mg IV Q3-4 hours PRN, Diazepam 15mg PO Q8H, and
Meperidine 100 mg IV BID PRN for Wound Vac Changes. Many
discussions were had with the patient regarding pain control.
Limit setting was essential in allowing for pain control without
the patient being oversedated. Psychiatry was consulted to
manage his anxiety. They had no specific recommendations at this
time for longterm treatment, but he should follow up as an
outpatient.
.
# Polysubstance abuse: At the time of admission, the patient was
currently clean and on methadone.  Pain was managed as noted
above.
.
# DM2: Oral hypoglycemics were held on admission.  [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted for help with management of his diabetes.  His blood
sugars were initially difficult to control in the setting of
infection.  Glargine insulin was started and was titrated up for
good glycemic control.  Humalog insulin sliding scale was also
used.
.
# s/p AVR: The patient was on coumadin at home for
anticoagulation.  When the need for operative management of his
hip arose, coumadin was discontinued and he was put on a heparin
gtt.  TTE and TEE were done to evaluate his valves when blood
cultures grew coag negative staph.  These studies were read as
having a question of mitral valve vegetation, as well as old
mitral valve perforation, but no involvement of the prosthetic
aortic valve was noted.  This was re-read as having NO
vegetation on the mitral valve.  The patient was treated for
endocarditis with vancomycin, with a plan for this to be
continued for 6 weeks.  On [**2200-5-27**], Coumadin 5mg QHS was begun.
His Heparin ggt was continued, but can be d/c'd once his INR is
therapeutic with a goal of 2.5-3.5. Upon discharge, INR was 2.5,
PTT was 114; however will continue Heparin drip, given the fact
that INR cannot be interpreted with elevated PTT.
.
# Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia on admission was felt to be
possibly [**12-19**] hypovolemia or benzo withdrawal and pain. He was
given IV hydration and was put on CIWA scale with valium which
he rarely required, as noted above.
.
# Pulmonary HTN: This was reported on TTE at OSH. The patient
had no signs or symptoms of RV strain.  Mild pulmonary artery
hypertension was also noted on TTE done here.
.
# Pancreatitis: Patient was noted to have elevated amylase and
lipase on admission, but without abdominal pain.  This was felt
to be related to medications, as the patient never developed any
symptoms of pancreatitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 48 year old male with history of DM, recent neck
surgery, history of heroin abuse; now admit after found altered
and cyanotic in car likely due to heroin overdose.

# Overdose (OD): Admits to heroin, vicodin, and valium use
without other abuses. No EtOH, sedatives, OTC meds, other
illicits. This is supported by toxicology screen. Some concern
initially of APAP OD if possible Vicodin use, however this was
negative on tox and not supported by history. Mental status
significantly improved on Narcan gtt which was weaned and
discontinued on the morning of [**2106-2-24**]. Patient was seen by
social work and was given the contact information for substance
abuse rehabilitation programs.

# Hyperglycemia. History of DM with poor medicine compliance.
The hyperglycemia was likely related to stress response from
hypoxia/respiratory acidosis plus poor baseline control. No
evidence of ketones, metabolic acidosis. He was managed with
insulin sliding scale, with Metformin held on admission.

# Leukocytosis. Also likely stress response from acute hypoxia
and acidosis. Other possibilities include infection (aspiration
pneumonia or CAP but CXR negative; UA clean; no evidence of
surgical site infection; denies h/o IVDU), alcoholic hepatitis.
This improved dramatically the morning following admission.  His
vlood cultures turned positive for peptostreptococcus and we
felt this was likley due to tooth surgery.  HIs cultures cleared
on antibiotics.

# Respiratory acidosis/hypercarbic respiratory failure. Likely
overmedication effect from heroin. Improved on Narcan gtt.

# Tachycardia. Sinus with normal ECG otherwise, and improved
with minimal IV fluids. This was likely related to above
episode.

# Wheezes. History of asthma; poor air entry and mild wheezing
on exam. He was started on flovent MDI (patient unsure of name
of inhaled steroid) and albuterol nebulizers.

# Heroin abuse. The patient denied any suicidal ideation and
expressed clearly that this was an accidental overdose. He
stated that he was amenable to a discussion with social
work/addiction specialists.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with heroin overdose. You were treated with a
medication, narcan, in the intensive care unit to counteract the
effects of the overdose.
.
You were found to have bacteria growing in your bloodstream and
you were treated with intravenous antibiotics. An MRI of your
neck was done to look for a source of infection. A small amount
of fluid was seen around the C-7 neck bone, the site of your
surgery and this was sampled. This fluid did not show signs of
infection. A syphillis test done was negative. A chest xray was
done to look for infection in your lungs and this was also
negative.
.
We also did an MRI of the rest of your spine which showed no
sign of infection. You have degenerative disk disease in your
lumbar spine
.
An echocardiogram of your heart was done. It showed no infection
on your heart valves but you do have a small hole in your heart
called a ""Patent Foramen Ovale"". It is important for you to let
your primary care doctor about this as it places you at higher
risk for having a stroke. Please call your doctor
.
Your metformin was stopped while you were admitted. You may
continue to take metformin as you were prior to your admission.


Followup Instructions:
Please make a follow up appointment with your primary care
doctor as soon as you are discharged. You will need to follow up
with him as soon as possible about the issue mentioned above.
.
Please make an appointment with your dentist as soon as
possible. Your teeth may have been the source of your blood
infection so you should be seen as soon as possible.
.
Please keep your follow up appointment with the neurosurgeons at
[**Hospital3 **] for your post-surgery check.

admitted [**12-13**] for menal status changes and respiratory
distress, intubated with pneumonia, sucessfully extubated, then
discharged to his NH on [**12-21**], who re-presents today with a
suspected methadone/benzo overdose responding to narcan in the
ED. He is on chronic methadone/oxycodone at his nursing home for
pain and was found unresponsive w/ a respiratory rate of 4 and
bp of 72/64, satting 88%, EMS was called and gave 4 mg narcan to
which he responded well, however he required two additional
doses for decreased respirations in the ED. Recieved 3 L of NS
for blood pressure support. Toxicology was consulted and
recommended against a narcan gtt. In the ED he desatted to
89-90% on 2L NC and was placed on NRB, subsequently desatted to
75-80% on NRB, lung exam ronchorous, gas at that time 7.37/48/54

admission showed resolving pneumonia, shortly prior to
intubation, showing worsened bibasilar infiltrates, possibly c/w
aspiration.

Brief Hospital Course:
A: 52 yo gentleman with h/o paraplegia [**2-19**] HTLV-1, multiple
sacral decubiti, COPD, and polysubstance abuse recently admitted
with pneumonia who p/w mental status changes likely socondary to
oversedation with methadone and acute hypoxic respiratory
distress likely secondary to aspiration event.  During
hospitalization the following problems were addressed:

1. mental status changes: The patient responded well to narcan
and was found to have methadone and benzo's in his utox which
suggests a medication overdose.  The [**Hospital1 33092**] staff was
suspicious that the patient was buying drugs on the street and
reported that there were no prescribed benzo's in their
medication list.  Toxicology was consulted in the ED and
recommended not starting a narcan gtt as patient was on high
doses (30mg QID). He was intubated and sedated initially with
propofol, then versed and fentanyl. When sedation was lifted he
was treated with low dose methadone at 15mg [**Hospital1 **] and prn morphine
prior to dressing changes.  It is recommended that he follow-up
with a pain specialist to develop a more appropriate dosing
regimen.  As his mental status responded to narcan, and the
patient had had a thorough work-up just two weeks prior during
his prior hospitalization, it was not felt his presentation
warrented head CT or LP.  B12 and folate levels were normal
during prior hospitalization earlier this month.  Psychiatry
consulted to determine whether this overdose was intentional.
From their assessment, it was an accidental overdose, and may
have been secondary to a medication error.  The complete tox
screen revealed Trileptal and Clozaril in his system, which were
confirmed by his nursing home to be ordered for another patient
on the same floor.  Once his mental status improved to baseline,
methadone was titrated up to a dose that ensured adequate pain
control and put the patient at less risk for oversedation.

2. hypoxic respiratory failure: this was thought to be due to an
aspiration event that occurred in the ED. The patient became
acutely agitated when receiving narcan.  He was treated
initially with levofloxacin and clindamycin for a possible
aspiration pneumonia.  On day two, vancomycin was added to the
regimen to cover for possible MRSA pneumonia given his previous
hospitalization history.  He was extubated on day #3, but
required supplemental oxygen by face mask and continued to
produce copious secretions/sputum.  CXR showed bilateral
consolidation and pulmonary edema.  The patient autodiuresed and
his respiratory function improved.  On day 3 his urine showed
psueudomonas so his antibiotic regiment was changed to
Vancomycin and Meorpenam.  His oxygen requirements weaned. The
Vancomycin discontinued after his MRSA screen was negative.  He
completed a 10 day course of meropenem.

3.  COPD:  the patient has severe COPD as evidenced by the
significant bullous disease seen on CXR.  He was treated for a
COPD flare during his last hospitalization earlier this month.
At this time he was continued on combivent MDI for secondary
prphylaxis and treatment.

4.  Right subtrochanteric fracture-he complained of R hip pain
during the admission. A bilateral hip film was done and revealed
the above fracture.  He underwent an ORIF repair, with
intramedullary nailing with cephalomedullary device, gamma nail
of right femur fracture.  He is post op day # 8 on the day of
discharge.  His course was complicated by 500cc intraop blood
loss, and postoperatively, by acute blood loss anemia and
hypotension. He was briefly on neosynephrine while in PACU.  A
CT of the abdomen and pelvis was done to rule out a
retroperitoneal bleed.  This CT revealed two tiny hematomas, in
right gluteus medius 3x2 cm and Ant Prox R thigh 3.4x 2.8cm.
These were felt to not be large enough to account for his HCT
drop.  He was guaiac negative and the bleeding was likely
postoperative bleeding into his thigh.  He received 4 units of
blood and his hematocrit subsequently stabilized.  He will need
to follow up with orthopedics in the week after discharge.  His
pain in his right leg is well controlled on his current regimen
of methadone, morphine elixir during dressing changes, RTC
tylenol, and neurontin.

5. CHF-He developed worsening shortness of breath two days after
receiving 4 units of blood for his acute blood loss anemia.  A
chest xray done at that time revealed bilateral new pleural
effusions, worsening opacities and stable large bullae.  This
was thought to be consistent with CHF.  He was diuresed
successfully with Lasix and his shortness of breath resolved.
He was able to breath at 97% on Room air, although his
respiratory efforts are diminished and he still therefore
appears to have an oxygen requirement.

6. polysubstance abuse: psychiatry was consulted, and methadone
resumed at a low dose.  The patient would also benefit from a
social work addictions consult given his two recent admissions
and continued risk for overdose and aspiration.  It is still
unclear whether this overdose was intentional or not.

7. Paraplegia: due to remote HTLV infection.  He was continued
on his bowel regimen and baclofen for muscle spasm.

8. Pain control: methadone resumed at lower dose.  Patient was
also given prn morphine during dressing changes.  Tyelenol and
Neurontin were also added to his regimen. He would likely
benefit from a pain management consult.

9. Decubitus ulcers:  wet to dry dressing changes were
continued.  The patient is supposed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in
plastic surgery for a possible skin graft to those areas.  Gram
stain of the ulcers showed 1+PMN, 1+GPC, 1+GNR.

10. UTI:  Urine culture was positive for pseudomonas.  His
suprapubic catheter was changed and he completed a ten day
course of meropenem.

11. Heparin induced thrombocytopenia-He has HIT which was
discovered during this admission.  He was put on argatroban
during his perioperative period.  Currently he is on
fondaparinux for prophylaxis as he is at significant.

History of Present Illness:
45 YO female with Hx of Hepatitis C c/b prior drug overdoses
x-ferred from [**Hospital3 **]with polysubstance overdose. Pt
found next to bottles of Quetiapine (seroquel) 90 x 200 mg,
Citalopram 30 x 20 mg, Benztropine 14 x 1mg.   Pt arrived at OSH
and was somnolent so intubated for airway protection and given
charcoal.  In ED toxicology evaluated patient, EKG with slight
increase in QRS duration (90-> 104) but did not change with
NaHCO3 bolus and toxicology did not feel this was suggestive of
TCA overdose.  Increased sedation by patient but no seizure
activity.  Utox and HCG negative.  Pt on arrival to unit was
hemodynamically stable, unarousable, and not overbreathing the
vent.
.
Since admission to the unit the patient was extubated on
[**2175-10-2**] with an episode of desaturation on the night of
extubation requiring face mask. The patient continued to have
periods of O2 desaturation with increasing tachypnea, requiring
at times a shovel mask with 70% oxygen and temperature spike.
The differential at this time was thought to be [**Doctor Last Name **] vs.
aspiration pneumonia and the patient was started on Levo and
Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia. Suspicion for PE at
this time was reported to be very low. Patient's chest film at
this time additionally demonstrated diffuse patchy opacities
concerning for infectious process vs. edema. Patient's course
was additionally complicated by large urine output, a total of
over 6L since admission without diuretics for which urine
osmoles were sent but were not consistent with diabetes
insipidus.

attempt presents with presumed quetiapine, citalopram,
benztropine, and TCA overdose intubated for airway protection.
.
1) Respiratory Failure- Initially intubated for airway
protection, but then noted to have a CXR which showed diffuse
patchy alveolar infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia
which is thought to have occurred in setting of overdose.  She
was started on levofloxacin and flagyl for aspiration pneumonia
and as she was ventilated for a ventilator acquired pneumona.
She will complete 2 week course.  By time of transfer, she is
doing well and does not require oxygen at rest or with
ambulation.  She was also noted to have some fullness of her
mediastinum on a plain film which should be followed with a
repeat CXR in 3months.
.
2) Drug overdose- Polysubstance: quetiapine, citalopram, and
benztropine, and serum tox positive for TCAs. EKG now with
normal QRS and QT intervals. She was monitored for
benzodiazxapine withdrawal but did not require treatment.
Dilated pupils and rigidity on exam on admission now resolved,
were likely secondary to anticholinergic toxidrome. Appears to
be experiencing akathisia as well as some muscle twitching,
unclear whether this is baseline. She states she has been taking
Cogentin for this.  She was seen by psyhciatry during this
hospitalization and was restarted on seroquesl and klonopin so
far.  Her regemin can be further titrated at a psychiatric
facility.  Her EKG was stable prior to discharge.
.
3) Depression with psychotic features: again followed by
psychiatry. Patient has had previus suicide attempts in the past
and was watched with a sitter while here for suicide precautions
and can be followed at an inpatient psych facility for further
management of her psychaitric condition.
.
4) Hepatitis C: States she has undergone treatment with
interferon and ribavirin earlier this year, last dose 2-3 months
ago. Per pt, Hep C viral load after treatment was undetectable.
LFTs are currently normal. GI care at outside hospital.  LFTs
were stable during current admission.
.
5) Discharge condition:  Good, she is breathing comfortably on
room air at rest and with ambulation. She was here with
aspiration pneumonia during her acute overdose event. She still
has a mildly increased respiratory rate, thought secondary to
anxiety, as her oxygenation is back to baseline and her chest
x-ray shows resolving pneumonia. She will comnplete a course of
oral antibiotics, but is back to baseline and medically clear.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 23 year old female with h/o SLE, lupus nephritis
and ESRD on HD, and poorly controlled HTN on multiple
medications presenting on [**8-25**] with unresponsiveness, bilateral
lower extremity weakness, and nausea/vomiting.  She was in her
USOH until 2 days pta, when she developed n/v, and on the day of
admission, she was found lying on the floor unresponsive to
family members.  Upon awakening she found that she could not
move either of her legs.  She was taken to the EW, where she had
BP 260s/200s, had a non-contrast head CT showing left frontal
ICH, right parieto-occipital ICH, and edema throughout
bilaterally thought to be c/w PRES (posterior reversible
encephalopathy syndrome) with superimposed ICH, and had a
MRI/MRV to exclude venous thrombosis showing ICH in the
parieto-occipital lobes bilaterally and pons without venous
sinus thrombosis.  She had a tonic-clonic seizure in the ED
terminated with 2 mg IV lorazepam.  Neurosurgery was consulted
and felt that she should be managed non-surgically, a labetalol
drip was started with a target SBP of 160s-180s, and she was
admitted to the MICU.
.
In the MICU, she was initially maintained on the labetolol gtt.
She was also started on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis. She
was intubated to have an MRI of the head, as there was concern
for sinus venous thrombosis. MRI was negative for thrombosis.
She transiently required phenylepherine for BP maintenence while
she was on a propofol gtt for maintenence of sedation. She was
extubated on [**8-26**]. While in the ICU she was seen by nephrology
who did not think she needed acute HD. Hematology was also
consulted as the patient had thrombocytopenia and hemolytic
anemia. They did not think she had TTP and thought it was more
likely [**Last Name (un) 1724**] from hypertensive emergency. Additionally, she had
[**3-12**] sets of blood cultures from [**8-25**] grow oxacillan resistant
coagulase negative staph and was started on vancomycin. TTE was
done and negative for vegetation. Her PO BP meds were uptitrated
in the ICU and SBPs have been <180s in the past 24 hours.  She
was transferred to the Medicine Team.
.
Upon transfer to Medicine team, the patient's SBPs were being
maintained between 150-160's and on po medications.  She denied
fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, headache, chest pain, or
shortness of breath.

STUDIES:
=========
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2140-8-25**]
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 11:49 a.m.:
Tip of the new endotracheal tube, with the chin slightly flexed
is no more than 15 mm above the carina, 2 cm below optimal
placement, as reported to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 805**] by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2026**] on
[**8-25**]. An ascending caval catheter ends in the low right atrium.
Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. There is no pneumothorax
or pleural effusion. Lungs are clear and heart size is normal.
No pneumothorax.
.
MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2140-8-25**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal areas of cortical T2 signal hyperintensity, some
with foci of recent hemorrhage. The most affected areas are the
parietal and occipital lobes, as well as the pons. The
appearance may represent posterior reversible encephalopathy
syndrome. Hemorrhage and pontine involvement in this disorder is
somewhat unusual, but has been described in the literature.
.
2. No definite evidence of major venous sinus thrombosis.
Nevertheless, if further evaluation is felt necessary
clinically, axial and coronal-acquired 2D time-of-flight MR
venography sequences could be performed, allowing each of the
major venous sinuses to be imaged orthogonally, a procedure
which would minimize any in-plane flow artifacts simulating
thrombus. However, this diagnosis, even at present, is
considered highly unlikely.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2140-8-25**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute intraparenchymal hemorrhages peripherally in the right
parietoccipital and left frontal lobes, with surrounding edema
and local mass effect.
.
2. Vasogenic and interstitial edema in a strikingly symmetric
and posterior distribution involving both [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter
of the occipital lobes and frontalparietal regions, bilaterally.
.
COMMENT: These findings are highly suggestive of PRES
(hypertensive encephalopathy), with development of superimposed
hypertensive hemorrhages. However, given the history of SLE,
suspicion of underlying ""lupus anticoagulant"" and non-arterial
distribution of edema and hemorrhage, cerebral venous (including
dural venous sinus) thrombosis should be excluded, and urgent
MRI with MRV has been recommended, below.
.
The results were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 698**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], EU
resident, at the time of study.
.
2. Right maxillary sinus mucus retention cyst.
.
CHEST (SINGLE VIEW)  [**2140-8-25**]
IMPRESSION: Unremarkable chest radiograph.
.
EKG [**2140-8-25**]
Sinus tachycardia. Voltage criteria for left ventricular
hypertrophy. Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities, most likely
related to left ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2140-7-30**] lateral ST-T wave abnormalities have
improved.
TRACING #1
.
EKG [**2140-8-26**]
Sinus tachycardia. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2140-8-25**]
no significant diagnostic change.
TRACING #2
.
ECHO [**2140-8-26**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is severe symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction. The gradient increased with the Valsalva manuever.
The findings are consistent with hypertrophic obstructive
cardiomyopathy (HOCM). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-5-20**], no
change.
.
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 23 yo female with a h/o SLE with secondary lupus
nephritis, uveitis s/p left eye enucleation, question of APLS
and poorly controlled HTN who presented on [**8-25**] with N/V,
lethargy, fatigue and headaches, found to have hypertensive
emergency,who subsequently seized.  CT head showed multiple
intraparenchymal hemorrhages.
.
# Hypertensive Emergency with ICH: Patient initially presented
with significantly elevated blood pressures resulting in end
organ damage causing seizure and intracranial hemorrhage. Her
intracranial bleed appears to be most consistent with PRES,
though septic emboli are on the differential. Goal SBP 150-160s.
Continued dilantin 100 mg tid for seizure prophylaxis, and pt
scheduled for follow up at neuro clinic in two weeks after
discharge.  Continued po regimen of labetolol 1000 mg TID,
hydralazine 75 mg PO BID (the only change in home meds),
lisinopril 40 mg [**Hospital1 **], valsartan 320 mg PO daily, nicardapine 60
mg PO TID, as well as clonidine patch when transferred to the
floor.  Pt achieved goal of SBPs in 150-160s on this regimen and
was discharged home.
.
# Bacteremia: She had high grade bacteremia with 6/6 bottles on
[**8-25**] growing oxacillan resistant coagulase negative staph.  HD
cath was d/c'ed. A TTE was negative for vegetation. Blood
cultures from [**8-27**] and [**8-28**] showed NGTD.  Pt started on
vancomycin.  Levels were followed to achieve therapeutic goals.
Ideally, vancomycin would be continued for 14 days after first
negative blood cultures.  Repeatedly, pt was told that
vancomycin was superior to linezolid for bacteremia, but she
still refused PICC. Thus, pt started on po linezolid and
discharged with linezolid. She will need close follow up for
bone marrow suppression secondary to linezolid.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Patient has had previous episodes of
clinical illness with acute drop in platelets with question of
consumptive coagulopathy from thrombosis vs. secondary to
malignant hypertension. Received one unit platelets with
placement of R femoral line. Platelets slowly improved over
hospitalization. Evaluated by heme who did not think
thrombocytopenia was consistent with TTP, but more likely to be
due to malignant hypertension.  Platelets counts improved with
improvement in blood pressures.
.
# SLE: The patient was previously treated with
Cytoxan/Prednisone and on admission was on low dose prednisone.
There had been concern in the past for anti-phospholipid
syndrome but her APA testing has been negative. Rheum consulted.
 Pt on 15 mg prednisone during hospitalization and discharged
with this dose and follow up.
.
# CKD stage V - Patient most recently had not been to HD for 3
weeks because she did not like the way it made her feel. Some
residual kidney function and awaiting kidney transplantation
from a relative. HD catheter was pulled during this admission
due to high grade bacteremia.  Per renal, not imperative that pt
needs acute HD.  Electrolytes monitored.  Sevelamer and daily
Kayexalate continued during hospitalization.
.
#. Anemia - Thought to be chronic and likely related to her CKD.
There was concern for hemolytic anemia during this admission,
likely caused by malignant hypertension. Hct trended up during
hospitalization.  Continued Epogen 4000 u three times/wk per
renal.

on 4LNC. She was started on a nicardipine drip. She denied
shortness of breath or chest pain. She is due for HD today. She
has a left groin catheter which was recently placed [**2141-12-21**] and

Brief Hospital Course:
24 yo woman with hx of SLE, ERSD on HD, admitted with
hypertensive urgency. Patient was initially observed in the MICU
and placed on a nicardipine drip. Patient was stablized on home
medicaitons, suggesting medication non-compliance. Additionally,
patient presented subtheraputic on coumadin for SVC thrombosis.
Patient was started on heparin ggt. After the nicardipine drip
was turned off, patient was called out to the floor. Heparin
drip was continued until INR [**2-13**]. Pressures were managed to her
baseline. Pain medications were decreased as patient has hypoxia
and altered mental status from over sedation, which was reversed
with Narcan. Patient received dialysis 3x/wk as per outpatient
schedule.

# Hypertension: Pt with extensive history of repeated admissions
for hypertension. Patient's BP improved with nicardipine drip
and after HD off drip on home PO medication regimen. Resumed
oral antihypertensives with improved BP control. HTn likely from
renal disease, possible medication noncompliance, lupus. No
evidence of MI. Continued nifedipine, aliskerin labetalol,
hydralazine, and clonidine at current doses. Renal increased
clonidine patch, and added Nicardipine with improvement of BP
control. Pt is to follow up with an appointment in the next week
to establish care at [**Company 191**], and to re-check her BP and adjust
medications further.

# SLE:  Stable, continued prednisone at 4 mg PO daily.

# Left groin pain. Permanent HD line was placed on [**12-25**]. Line
and hematoma from prior peritoneal line on abdomen okay. No
leukocytosis or fevers to suggest infection. Patient was
oversedated on Dilaudid and had episode of oxygen desaturation
which was reversed with Narcan. Patient was solmolent with
morphine SR so that was d/c'ed as well, patient was given
standing tylenlol and Morphine IR PRN. Transplant surgery
removed remaining sutures today from L groin. Pt has a follow-up
appointment in the next week with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (Transplant
Surgery). She will be sent home with low-dose Morphine IR and
Tylenol PRN pain. If L groin pain should become uncontrollable
on current meds, pt should return to the ED for re-evaluation.
It is anticipated that pain should resolve, as line placement
occured over 2 weeks ago.

#ESRD: Renal following, continuing HD Th/Th/Sat. CaCO3 was
started for elevated calcium-phosphate product. Pt will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7473**] in the next 1-2 weeks.

# Anemia: Pt's baseline is 26. This is likely secondary to AOCD
and renal failure.  Hct was stable on day of discharge at 25.9.

# SVC thrombus: Pt has a history of an SVC thrombus, and is on
coumadin. She is supposed to be on lifelong anticoagulation due
to recurrent thrombosis but INR subtherapeutic on arrival.
Heparin drip was stopped on the floor once the INR was
theraputic. INR was therapeutic on day of discharge. Pt will
need an INR check in the next week at her follow-up with her
PCP.

# HOCM: Pt has evidence of myocardial hypertrophy on Echo. She
is currently not symptomatic. Echo did not show evidence of
worsening pericardial effusion. She was continued on her
beta-blocker and other BP medications.

# Depression/anxiety: Stable. She was continued on Celexa and
Clonazepam.

# OSA: Pt as continued on CPAP for sleep with 7 pressure.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnosis: Hypertensive Urgency
End Stage Renal Disease


Discharge Condition:
stable, blood pressure moderately controlled, afebrile,
tolerating POs


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for headaches and very high blood pressures.
You were started on an IV medication for your blood pressure
which controlled it.  You were then started back on your home
medications with improvement of your blood pressure. Some of
medications were increased as your hypertension was difficult to
control.

You were also started on a heparin drip while restarting your
coumadin since you have a known clot in your veins.  You will
need to take the coumadin as prescribed by your doctor, and have
your INR checked frequently per your PCP's recommendations.

Please take all medications as prescribed.  It is important that
you do not miss doses of your medications since your blood
pressure is very sensitive to missed doses.  Please keep all
scheduled appointments.

If you develop any of the following concerning symptoms, please
call your PCP or go to the ED: fevers, chills, chest pains,
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or headaches.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 45 year-old male with history of HIV/AIDS([**4-12**] CD4 53,
VL < 50), HCC (w/ cirrhosis) who was found to have mental status
changes after taking tincture of opium. The patient says he has
had diarrhea for 2 years, but has been worse over past couple of
days. Usually this is relieved with loperamide, though over last
2 days diarrhea worse and took opium. The morning of the
admission the patient took an unknown amount of opium and mother
noted patient was somnolent and difficult to arouse. The patient
said with the recent diarrhea he had some abdominal pain,
nausea, fever to 101 and some streaks of blood in his stool.
Based on his somnolence he was brought to ED.
.
In the ED, patient received naloxone 0.8mg with intermittent
improvement in mental status followed by relapse to original
state. He also complained of headache at this time. Due to
headache and concern for meningitis, patient received head CT
and also 1 dose of acyclovir, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. Blood
cultures were sent prior to this. He was also given lactulose
for possible hepatic encephalopathy. Due to concern for naloxone
requirement and periods of apnea, patient was transferred to
MICU for further respiratory monitoring.
.
His micu course was uncomplicated, he had some meds (trazodone,
mirtazapine, percocet and clonazepam) held to prevent further
somnolene and he was given lactulose for high ammonia. Initially
treated for presumed meningitis given fevers, given ceftriaxone,
azithromycin and vancomycin His mental status improved and he
was transferred to medicine.
.
Currently patient feels well, had formed, non-bloody stool
today.

Brief Hospital Course:
45 y.o. male with history of AIDS, HCV cirrhosis, polysubstance
abuse, diarrhea, admitted for mental status changes and
respiratory monitoring.
.
His micu course was uncomplicated, he had some meds (trazodone,
mirtazapine, percocet and clonazepam) held to prevent further
somnolence and he was given lactulose for high ammonia.
Initially treated for presumed meningitis given fevers, he was
given ceftriaxone, azithromycin and vancomycin. His mental
status improved and he was transferred to medicine.
.
Floor course:
.
#) Mental status changes - The patient's mental status changes
were likely related to his overdose of opium, as his mental
status improved through his course.  Given his elevated ammonia
a concern for encephalopathy was raised, but this was unlikely.
Given this concern the patient was initially treated with
lactulose, and rifaximin. With the history of fever and headache
in ED, he was initially treated for meningitis, though on the
floor he was afebrile with no meningismus, so concern for
meningitis was low and he was not treated any further.  On the
floor, his mental status improved and this was again related to
opium overdose.  Given this his lactulose and rifaximin were
stopped.  He was doing well prior to discharge, and as blood
cultures were sent in the ED, and should be followed as an
outpatient.
.
#) Cirrhosis: The patient had improved mental status on the
floor, and while he had elevated ammonia it was unlikley he had
encephalopathy, so his lactulose and rifaximin (given in the ED
and MICU) were stopped. He did not appear to have a large amount
of ascites, though given his delicate fluid balance he had an US
which showed minimal ascites. As he had Acute renal failure, his
lasix and spironolactone were held, and his fluid balance was
closely followed.  His renal function improved prior to
discharge, so to prevent fluid overload his diuretics were
restarted at a lower dose, and he will be followed closely by ID
and the coinfection clinic as an outpatient, so he is maintained
on the appropriate dose of diuretics to prevent reacummulation
of ascites.
.
#) HIV - The patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3394**], and he is on
appropriate medications.  He was followed by ID and was
continued on PCP and MAC prophylaxis with [**Last Name (STitle) 7615**] and
azithromycin respectively, and also continued on his
antiretroviral regimen (Emtricitabine, tenofovir, abacavir,
ritonavir, atazanavir).  He will be closely followed by ID and
the coinfection clinic as an outpatient.
.
#) Diarrhea - The patient has chronic diarrhea, and the acute
worsening was likely due to the lactulose he was given.  ID did
not feel this was infectious, though stool cultures were sent
and should be followed as an outpatient.  With the
discontinuation of his lactulose and rifaximin, and with
starting imodium, the patient's diarrhea improved and he was at
baseline for discharge.
.
#) Chronic thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of bone
marrow toxicity secondary to Bactrim/AZT.  His thrombocytopenia
appears stable during this admission and was not an active
issue.
.
#) Acute renal failure - The patient has a baseline creatinine
that appears to be around 0.9-1.0, and this was elevated to 1.3.
This was likely due to dehydration in setting of diarrhea for
this patient.  His lasix and spironolactone were held and with
IVF his renal function returned to baseline.  He was restarted
on a lower dose of his diuretics prior to discharge, and will
need his dose of diuretics readjusted as an outpatient and
should have his creatinine closely monitored as well.

Chief Complaint:
Hypoxic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Extubation (intubated at outside hospital).

History of Present Illness:
39 year old female with history of type 2 diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, heavy smoking history, and benzodiazepine
and narcotic abuse in the past, who presented to [**Hospital **]
Hospital this morning complaining of 3 days of dyspnea, nausea,
and vomiting.  The history has been obtained via chart review,
and discussion with the family, as the patient is intubated and
without records at [**Hospital1 18**].  Per the family, she was in her usual
state of health until about 3 days ago when she complained to a
relative that she wasn't sleeping at night.  She also was having
nausea and vomiting, brown emesis.  This is all we know about
recent symptoms.  Her 15 year old son let her relatives know
that something wasn't right this morning, and she was found
disoriented, with only one shoe on, appearing unwell, at which
point she was brought by her family to [**Hospital1 **].

At [**Hospital1 **], initial vitals were HR 98, 134/63, 95% on ? RA.
Given diffuse expiratory wheezes on examination she was given
solumedrol 125 mg IV x 1.  A CXR revealed a LLL pneumonia and
she was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  She had
persistent hypoxia, with desaturation to the high 80s and
initial ABG 7.21/61/74, prompting intubation.  Additionally,
cardiac enzymes were elevated with a CK of 1900, MB of 25 with a
normal MB index, and elevated troponin I to 0.43 (nl < 0.1).  An
EKG showed lateral TWI in I and aVL, without ST segement
changes.  Labs also notable for a leukocytosis at 24,000, with
83% PMNs and 2% bands.

On transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was febrile to 102.2.  CXR
confirmed a LLL pneumonia, at which point vancomycin was added
to her regimen. Initial ABG was 7.17/66/242. Cardiology was
consulted given the cardiac enzyme elevation at the outside
hospital, and given that she had no EKG changes, they
recommended holding off on heparin for now and trending the
enzymes.  Repeat set here pending, but troponin is < 0.01.  Labs
otherwise notable for a leukocytosis at 22,000, hyperkalemia of
5.3, and hyperglycemia of 260.  Lactate was normal (0.7).  Blood
and urine cultures were sent.


Past Medical History:
1) Type 2 diabetes
2) Hypercholesterolemia
3) Narcotic, benzodiazepine abuse
4) Heavy smoking history.  No history of asthma or COPD that the
family is aware of.


Social History:
She has a 15 year old son with whom she lives.  She is not
married.  Most of her family members live in the area.  She
smokes at least 2 PPD for the last 25 years.  As above, she has
abused benzodiazepines including clonazepam, as well as
oxycontin, depakote, and sertraline in the past, and has been
through detox.  Her family does not think she has abused in over
a year, as they could tell when she was using drugs in the past.
 Her family denies IVDU on her part.


Family History:
Her father had an MI at the age of 37.  Her mother does not have
heart trouble.

Port CXR [**10-13**] - 1) NG tube tip coiled with its tip in the
proximal esophagus.
2) Endotracheal tube tip approximately 2 cm above the carina.
3) Large left basilar consolidation/effusion, suspicious for
pneumonia in the right clinical context.
4) Ill-defined right hilar opacity may relate to a component of
aspiration.
.
NCHCT [**10-13**] - There is no evidence of acute intra- or
extra-axial hemorrhage. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is
preserved.  There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally
midline structures. There is opacification of the nasopharynx in
this intubated patient, presumabl collapsed airway as well as
fluid content.
.
EEG [**10-16**] - Markedly abnormal EEG due to the slow and
disorganized
background along with bursts of generalized slowing, some of
which
included spike or sharp and slow wave rhythmic patterns. These
findings
indicate a widespread encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic
disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
Nevertheless, the bursts of generalized slowing included spike
or sharp
and slow wave features and raise concern for the possibility of
seizures. The discharges were not so prolonged on this recording
as to
indicate ongoing seizures now, but this remains a concern for
other
times. If the patient's status changes or a concern for
non-convulsive
seizures persist, additional recordings would be of benefit.
.
CXR (PA and lat) [**10-17**] - The heart size is normal.  Mediastinum
has normal position, contour and width. There is no evidence of
hilar enlargement.  The lungs are clear.  A better technique
chest x-ray demonstrates absence of any mass in the right middle
lobe.  The pleural surfaces are smooth with no pleural effusion
.
MRI [**10-17**] FINDINGS:  The posterior fossa structures are normal.
The cerebral parenchyma has normal brain white matter
differentiation.  The ventricles and the extraaxial CSF spaces
are unremarkable.  However, in the cervicomedullary region,
there is subtle area of increased signal intensity on the FLAIR
images (series 6, image 2), which is incompletely evaluated, as
no sagittal FLAIRS are available.  No obvious contrast
enhancement is noted in this area on the sagittal post-contrast
images.


Brief Hospital Course:
39 year old female with history of type 2 diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, heavy smoking history, and benzodiazepine
and narcotic abuse in the past, presenting with dyspnea and
hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to left lower lobe
pneumonia.

1) Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to drug
overdose. Upon further questioning with the family, it was
revealed that pt had taken a large amount of methadone (unknown
dose) that were found in a Vicodin bottle. Pt intubated at [**Hospital **]
transferred to MICU here and self-extubated the next day without
any subsequent difficulty protecting her airway, no problems
with hypoxia, hypercarbia. Was placed on ceftriaxone and
azithromycin for treatment of a community acquired pneumonia.
Was febrile on presentation with elevated WBC to 21 with left
shift.  She was started on steroids at the outside hospital for
question of obstructive component given wheezes on exam, however
here, her resistance was not elevated on the ventilator, she had
no wheezes, and no history of obstructive lung disease,
therefore steroids were discontinued. Upon transfer to medical
floor, pt continued to sat well on room air.

2) Drug abuse:  Given the history of narcotic and benzodiazepine
abuse, a toxicology panel was ordered, and returned positive for
methadone and other opiates.  Additionally, her family found a
prescription bottle with Vicodin listed on the outside, but
filled with methadone tablets at home. She additionally had
clonazepam tablets at home.  She was placed on 1:1 sitter until
more information could be obtained from her.  She was quite
confused and sleepy for the first few days of the admission,
which subsequently cleared. Toxicology consulted and recommended
Quest lab screen for clonazepam and benzo tox screen in house
has 20% false negative rate for clonazepam. Spoke with pt's PCP,
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 70643**], who stated that he did not presribe clonazepam or
methadone for pt and was not aware that pt was on either drug.
Had prescribed MS Contin 15 mg po q12h and Vicodin 1 tab prn for
chronic pain issues in the past. Family voiced concern that pt
was either shopping around for pain meds with different MDs or
was trading pills with a friend. SW and addictions consult
obtained and provided counseling and support for the patient and
her family. Psych consult also obtained who felt that pt's
ingestion was not secondary to a suicide attempt and 1:1 sitter
d/c'd. As pt remained slow to answer questions when called out
to the medical floor, MRI head ordered and ruled out for anoxic
brain injury. EEG significant for diffuse slowing [**1-3**] toxic,
metabolic encephalopathy, with occasional burst of slow and
spiking wave activity concerning for seizures; however not
sustained enough to rule in active seizure activity. Pt
subsequently was quicker to answer questions, with clearing
encephalopathy and [**Hospital1 2824**] mood. Per psych and SW evaluation and
pt agreement, was transferred to dual diagnosis unit on a
voluntary basis.

3) Elevated cardiac enzymes:  Elevated at outside hospital,
however normal MB index.  Troponin normal here.  CK elevation
was thought to be non-specific and likely related to overlying
process of drug overdose.  It trended down quickly.  Her
simvastatin was held during the admission and restarted prior to
discharge.

4) HTN - Noted to have persistently elevated BPs, not at goal of
< 130/80. Started on lisinopril which was titrated up to 10 mg
po qd.

5) DM:  Her finger sticks were elevated on admission to the ICU,
and she was placed briefly on an insulin drip.  Shortly after
extubation she was transitioned to a sliding scale, and
metformin was restarted. Subsequently had FS mostly in the low
100s, occasionally with high to 170s.

Placed on DVT prophylaxis, bowel regimen.

Imaging:
CXR Portable ([**11-18**]): Since [**2141-11-16**], heart size
enlargement is unchanged due to known pericardial effusion.
Lungs are otherwise clear. Hilar contours are normal.
Incidentally, widening of both acromioclavicular joints is
unchanged.

CT A/P ([**11-18**]):
1. No evidence of bowel obstruction or rim-enhancing fluid
collection.
2. Large ascites, slightly increased from [**2141-11-13**], with
peritoneal dialysis catheter in place. Interval removal of
surgical skin staples along the abdomen.
3. Moderate pericardial effusion as before.
4. Symmetric heterogeneous attenuation of the kidneys could be
related to
renal failure; however, pyelonephritis could also give this

regions of
hypoattenuation seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Hypertension: Patient has history of extremely labile
hypertension on an aggressive outpatient regimen. Overnight in
the MICU, patient required IV and PO labetalol for SBP > 200.
Her hydralazine was increased from 75mg to 100mg TID with mild
improvement. Her labetalol was also increased from 300mg to
400mg TID. Her blood pressure also seemed to improve when her
pain decreased and was normal in the middle of the night. TSH
was sent and elevated, although free T4 was normal. Plasma
metanephrines were sent and pending at discharge.

2) Abdominal pain: CT scan showed increasing ascites, but no
acute pathology. Peritoneal fluid was obtained and contained 544
polys. Treatment was started with metronidazole and
levofloxacin, as well as vancomycin as 1 blood culture was
growing GPC pairs/clusters. Blood cultures ended up growing 1
out of 4 bottles coag-neg Staph, likely contaminant, so
vancomycin was stopped. Since nephrology felt her peritoneal
fluid polys were inflammatory but not infectious, the
levofloxacin and metronidazole were stopped. The peritoneal
cultures remained negative. Her PD catheter was left in place as
the patient refuses HD any longer than necessitated by the
healing of her recent laparotomy (see prior d/c summaries).

3) SVC/brachiocephalic thrombosis: Patient's INR was
subtherapeutic on admission at 1.3. Due to the proximal location
of her old venous thrombi, she was started on a heparin gtt.
This was continued during her admission and her warfarin was
increased to 5mg daily. Her INR reached 2.0 at discharge
(therapeutic range 2-3). The dose was lowered to 4mg daily at
discharge to prevent overshooting the therapeutic range, but the
patient will have close follow up with coumadin clinic, with
dose titrations as needed.

4) Anxiety: Patient noted feeling short of breath and anxious
around the time of her recent admissions. Her nephrologist felt
this may be contributing to her recurrent pain and hypertension,
so psychiatry was consulted. They felt her symptoms were
suggestive of anxiety and panic attacks, recommended checking
TSH and metanephrines as above, and starting citalopram 20mg,
which was done. She was advised on breathing exercises, which
seemed to have benefit, and given lorazepam 1mg q8h PRN. Patient
is agreeable to outpatient follow up with [**Company 191**] social work, and
potential CBT. These can be arranged by her PCP.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report
MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2155-4-9**] 8:21 PM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
44 year old man post op for rectal prolapse with bleeding after
placement of 17g spinal needle for epidural placement.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please evaluate for epidural hematoma and evidence of cord
compromise/ischemia. Please use contrast.
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study due to motion artifacts. Gadolinium was not
injected given this patient's motion on the pre-contrast images.
2. No obvious signs of epidural hematoma.
3. Degenerative disease and bulging throughout the lumbar spine,
predominantly at L3-4 to L5-S1 levels. Mild-to-moderate
bilateral foraminal narrowing at L4-5 level.
4. If there is continued concern, repeat study can be obtained
with sedation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] did well in the OR with minimal blood loss during the
procedure, but intraoperative Hct was 20 with most recent Hct in
[**2-27**]. Additionally, anesthesia attempted epidural placement
for pain control given patient's long history of chronic pain
and expected difficulty with pain control post operatively. A 17
guage spinal needle was placed without difficulty but suddenly
began to have large bleeding through the needle. This was
withdrawn, and the patient remained stable throughout. He was
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for neuro check monitoring in the event of
development of an epidural hematoma. Also, given his low hct,
the patient was transfused 2 units with close monitoring of HCT.

.
POD1-3: On arrival to the ICU, the patient was stable and was
transported to radiology for the MRI, which he did not tolerate
well secondary to movement. He was returned to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], with
wet reads on the MR (without contrast) being negative for
obvious bleed or cord compression. He was monitored in the ICU
for 2 days. Hct remained stable with no development of
Neurological deficits. Chronic pain service managed pain regimen
 by switching PCA to Methadone with improved pain control. He
continued with steroid taper. Started on sips of water, advanced
to clears. Tolerated well. Medications transistioned to oral,
including Prednisone and pain regimen per CPD recommendations.
Transferred to 12 [**Hospital Ward Name 1827**].
.
POD4: Neuro status stable. Vitals stable. Labwork stable.
Continued on PO Prednisone, home dosage. Tolerating regular
diet. Passing flatus. Abdomen soft ND, appropriately tender, OTA
with staples. Rectum intact. OOB with nursing assist. Ambulates
with cane at baseline, steady. Evaluated per Physical Therapy.
Cleared for discharge home. No services required. Pain regimen
titrated per Pain service. Methadone increased to 50mg PO BID.
Oxycodone 20mg PO q3-4 hours, and Lyrica 75mg PO BID (titrate up
to 100mg PO BID in  [**3-8**] days) added with increased pain relief.
Central line removed. Elevated blood sugars managed with Regular
insulin per sliding scale. Home Oral antiglycemic agents
continued.
.
POD5: Discharged to mother's home with 5 days of Ritalin, 3 days
of 50mg of PO Methadone (patient wil decrease Methadone dose
back to 40mg PO BID), and oxycodone 20mg PO q3-4 hours. Contact
[**Name (NI) 46607**]'s PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] via email with changes to pain
regimen. Patient advised to follow-up with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 1 week. In

field and transferred to [**Hospital3 7569**]. On arrival he was
hypotensive with no purposeful movements. He was given narcan
6mgIV with no response. CT head was negative per OSH and labs
were significant for WBC 50.2 with 28% bands, glucose 1259 with
AG 35, K 7.2. On ABG 6.88/23/94/4.3/89% and lactate 2.6.

CXR was consistant with multifocal penumonia and question of
aspiration. He received zosyn, unasyn, 4L IV NS, 1 amp Ca
gluconate, 1amp HCO3. Given no intensivist available at [**Location (un) **]
ED he was Transfered [**Hospital1 18**] by [**Location (un) 7622**].

On arrival to ED, patient was hypotensive (83/45, hr 80s),
received 4L IV NS, IV vancomycin and zosyn were started. Insulin
drip at 8U/hr was initiated and FS 780 reported prior to ICU
transfer. Levophed drip was initiated

According to family (ex-wife provided history), he has had
recurrent episodes of hyperglycemia (to the 500s) at home. Last
week he was taken to [**Hospital3 7569**] (by ambulance) for
hyperglycemia where he was admitted for several days. Prior to
this he had teeth pulled and was given pain medications but not
antibiotics. He also recently had a fall and was taken to OSH
for stitches to his head. He is known to have peripheral
neuropathy and takes several types of pain medications,
including a duragesic patch. Otherwise he has not had any other
medical issues or symptoms to her knowledge.

-------------------
IMAGING STUDIES:
CXR [**2128-1-19**]:Multifocal consolidative pulmonary abnormality,
continues to improve in the left lung since [**2128-1-16**], while
the right lung improved between [**2128-1-16**] and [**2128-1-18**], and
has remained stable or worsened slightly since. Findings are
consistent with pulmonary edema, including noncardiogenic
causes, including ingestion and drug reaction, as well as
pulmonary hemorrhage or unusual condition such as chronic or
acute eosinophilic pneumonia.
------
CT Abdomen and Pelvis [**2128-1-19**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited examination secondary to lack of intravenous contrast
and
opacification of small bowel with oral contrast. Possible short
segment of
small bowel wall thickening in the left mid abdomen. The
differential
diagnosis is broad and includes infectious, ischemic and
inflammatory
etiologies for enteritis.
2. Rectal wall thickening and perirectal stranding suggestive of
proctitis.
3. Ascites and anasarca. Lack of intravenous contrast, limits
sensitivity for
the detection of a small intra-abdominal abscess. No large
intra-abdominal
abscess.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar consolidations and
scattered
ground glass opacities suspicious for pneumonia.
5. Unchanged bilateral nonobstructive renal calculi.
6. Right renal low attenuation lesion, incompetely
characterized, likely
representing a cyst.
-------
CXR [**2128-1-25**]: IMPRESSION: Probable marginal improvement in extent
of pneumonia.
-------
MRI c-spine [**2128-1-24**]: CONCLUSION: Mild degenerative disc disease
with a small midline protrusion at C6-7 that does not contact
the spinal cord. The study is limited in quality due to motion
artifact, but there is no definite evidence of neural foraminal
encroachment.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 47 year old man with history of Type I diabetes
mellitus found unresponsive at home with hyperglycemia and
metabolic acidosis, likely in DKA, also found to have multifocal
PNA and acute renal failure/metabolic acidosis.

1) Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Pt with a history of type I diabetes
mellitus that has been poorly controlled in the past with
multiple hospital admission for DKA. As per HPI pt found
unresponsive with significantly elevated blood sugar transferred
from OSH for intensivist management of DKA. DKA likely secondary
to infection, with possible sources being pneumonia +/- recent
tooth extraction. Patient admitted to the medical ICU and
insulin drip initiated. [**Last Name (un) **] endocrine consult service
immediately became involved in hospital course. Patient
eventually transitioned to Lantus and Humalog sliding scale.
Given significant renal failure patient's insulin regimen has
required close monitoring and daily adjustments. At this time
renal function continues to improve. Anticipate that Lantus dose
will need to be increased. Currently on Lantus 12 qHS and
relatively aggressive humalog sliding scale. Please monitor
blood glucose carefully and adjust both lantus and humalog as
needed. Would suggest that patient have diabtes follow up at
[**Last Name (un) **] following discharge from rehab.

2) Respiratory Failure: Pt found unresponsive at home and
intubated at OSH and remained intubated when transferred to the
MICU. Found to have combination of pulmonary edema and bilateral
pulmonary infiltrates. Was diuresed which improved respiratory
status. Determined to have sputum cultures positive for MRSA and
treated for multifocal pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn.
Patient's respiratory status eventually permitted extubation. He
was transferred to the medical floor on 2-3L of oxygen via nasal
cannula and O2 sats have beens stable around 94-96%. Description
of penumonia treatment regimen listed below. Would suggest
continuing to wean oxygen as tolerated.

3) Acute renal failure/ Metabolic acidosis: On admission ABG was
6.88/23/94/4.3/89% and lactate 2.6. Also found to have acute
renal failure with a creatinine of 5.1. Metabolic acidosis felt
to be due to a combination of DKA, rhabdomyolysis, infection and
question of ingestion. Acute renal failure likely secondayr to
dehydration and hypotension secondary to DKA leading to a
pre-renal/ATN picture. Metabolic significantly improved with
resolution of DKA as well as treatment pneumonia. He was
followed by the renal service who also recommended oral
bicarbonate which was discontinued when bicarbonate corrected
and renal function improved. Renal failure has continued to
trend down and is 2.8 at time of discharge. Would suggest
continuing to follow creatinine. Please also monitor bicarbonate
and assess for whether oral bicarbonate supplementation needed.
Continue to renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.

4)Multifocal Pneumonia/MRSA Pneumonia: Sputum sample positive
for MRSA, sensitive to Vancomycin. Patient started on
Vancomycin/Zosyn. Patient has remained afebrile for nearly his
enture time on the medicine [**Hospital1 **]. White count is normal at time
of discharge. As noted abovePatient will need a total of 14 day
course of this antibiotic combination since his last negative
sputum cx ([**2128-1-19**]).Last dose on [**2128-2-1**]. Vancomycin dosed q48
given GFR of 11 at time of discharge. His next dose should be
[**2128-1-30**].

5)Diarrhea: Patient has had diarrhea since about [**2128-1-18**]. He
has been negative for cDiff x 4. We do not think this is
infectious, likely side effect from antibiotic side effect.
However, we have treated him empirically for cdiff with
metronidazole. He will finish a 14 day course on that will be
finished on [**2128-2-2**].

6) Anemia: Found to be anemic to 23 and required 1 unit PRBC
during this admission. Had guiac positive stool. Feel he likely
has gastritis that may be oozing and suggest an EGD as an
outpatient which will need to be scheduled. Please note on day
of DC his Hct 22. We suggest checking a Hct within the next few
days to monitor.

7) Right Upper Extremity Weakness: Pt unable to lift right upper
extremity. Had cervical MRI which was negative for mass or
abscess. Seen by neuro that felt he has a C5/C6 radiculopathy or
an upper trunk plexopathy likely [**2-23**] to being found down. He
will need to have neurology appointment scheduled 1-2 months
from today.

8) Chronic Neuropathic Pain: Patient has hx of chronic pain,
especially in his back. Pain has been managed with fentanyl
patches and IV morphine. He should be con on his outpt dose of
Neurontin 300 mg TID. Given patient's questionable hx of
substance abuse suggest trying to wean down morphine as
tolerated. Suspect that pain will improve when patient not bed
bound and able to be more mobile. Please note he was on percocet
5/325mg [**1-23**] QDailyPRN prior to admission.

9) Scrotal Edema: Pt has significant pain from scrotal edema
which is [**2-23**] fluid resucitation and continued volume
redistribution. We have started him on lasix 20 mg daily.
Suggest monitoring creatinine and stopping this medication if
worsening Cr or if scrotal edema improves.

10) Depression: Pt continued on his lexapro. He does have a
rather flat affect and seems to be rather down given his current
situation. Suggest coordinating counseling during rehab stay and
following discharge.

11) ? Vertigo: Pt on meclizine 20mg Q8PRN as an outpt for
presumed BPPV. We have held this medication given it's sedating
effect given he is on other sedating meds.

12) Hypertension: Patient started on HCTZ 12.5 mg daily for
elevated blood pressure prior to discharge. Suggest checking CHM
7 to monitor electrolytes. [**Month (only) 116**] need to be titrated up.

Patient was a FULL code during this admission.

months ago. Pt went to rehab at CAB in [**Location (un) 86**] approx 1 week ago
for 7 day stay but felt her rehab stay didn't address her
addiction issues. She reports being treated with librium and
clonidine. She completed her rehab stay two days ago. She says
that due to ongoing stress within her marriage she again used
heroin earlier today. She reports that after feeling her inital
rush after her injection she began reacting poorly and feeling

IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.


Brief Hospital Course:
The pt is a 44y/o F admitted with heroin overdose.

Heroin Overdose - pt w/ respiratory depression in ED requiring
narcan. On arrival to ICU this has resolved.  Need for recurrent
narcan may be related GI absorption of swallowed heroin. It was
unclear whether the bag of heroin ingested had ruptured and she
had absorbed the drug.  Toxicology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and they stated
safest would be to start the patient on golytely until the
heroin bag passes or her stool output is clear and to monitor
her in a medical setting until this is complete.  She signed out
against medical advice, understanding the risks of this
including GI obstruction, heroin overdose or death.  Discharged
with recommendations to follow up with her PCP for help with a
drug rehab program.  upon discharge no signs of heroin
intoxication or withdrawal, the patient has capacity to make
this decision.  She denies any thoughts of suicide.

Polysubstance abuse - pt with recent relapse despite rehab stay.
Urine tox positive for cocaine, benzos and opiates. Pt reports
benzo screen positive due to librium use at rehab.

Hep C - pt reports stable LFTS followed as outpatient. Recommend
continued outpatient management.

Ecchocardiogram: Severe symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal regional LV systolic function. Hyperdynamic LVEF >75%.
Moderate resting LVOT gradient. LVOT gradient increases with
Valsalva.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta
diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. No 2D or Doppler evidence
of distal arch coarctation.  AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve
leaflets (3). Trace AR.  MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve
leaflets with trivial MR. No MVP.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Echocardiographic results were reviewed with
the
houseofficer caring for the patient.
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5mmHg. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and dynamic systolic
function (LVEF>80%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. There is a moderate (25mmHg peak) resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction that increased (64mmHg)
with the Valsalva manuever. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Marked symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
dynamic
systolic function and resting LVOT gradient that increased with
Valsalva.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-12-4**],
the severity of left ventricular hypertrophy has increased and
trace aortic regurgitation is now identified. Dynamic LV
systolic function and the resting intracavitary gradient are
similar.

1.  Abrupt occlusion of the right internal jugular vein and its
distal most aspect as it joins with the distal subclavian vein.
2.  Recanalization of the left subclavian vein with some
peripheral residual clot.  Recommend analysis of the SVC,
central subclavians and internal jugular veins with dedicated
magnetic resonance venography, which can be performed without
intravenous contrast for a global assessment of the venous
patency.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 22 yo female with SLE, ESRD on HD, amongst other
problems who presented with symptoms likely [**2-12**] bacteremia.
Found to be in hypertensive urgency after missing a run of
dialysis. She is now transferred to the floor for further
managment after dialysis x 1 and starting vancomycin.
.
In the MICU she was started kept briely on a labetalol gtt, and
then restarted on her home antihypertensives and dialyzed x 1
with resolution of hypertension. She was found to be bacteremic
and was started on vancomycin. She felt well and was transferred
to the floor.
.
1. Hypertensive urgency- Pt with long history of very
difficult-to-control HTN. She was initially on a labetalol gtt
as above, was dialyzed with resolution of her HTN urgency.  She
was then transitioned to her her outpatient medication regimen
of valsartan, lisinopril, clonidine, labetalol, terazosin, and
nicardipine at max doses, but because of persistent HTN to the
180's she was started on hydralazine 50mg po tid on discharge.
.
2. Coag negative staph bacteremia: most likely source is line
sepsis.  She was started on vancomycin and her blood cultures
cleared after 2 days in the hospital.  The patient felt strongly
about keeping her HD line, which was felt to be reasonable
because her infection was coag negative staph.  Ecchocardiogram
did not show any valvular vegitations.  She will continue on
vancomycin for 3 weeks at hemodialysis.
.
3. ESRD on dialysis-euvolemic clinically.  Had dialysis inhouse.
 Continued sevelamer.
.
4. Left uveitis/endopthalmitis-Continued prednisone 30 mg po
qday. Will also continue bacitracin-polymyxin b.
.
5. Lupus- not on any other medications than above.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6114**]
Chief Complaint:
change in mental status, respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation


History of Present Illness:
49 yo female with history of hepatitis C cirrhosis (grade II-III
with stage I dz, VL 3,500,000), severe emphysema requiring
several intubations, remote history of nasal cocaine, IVDU
(heroin) and alcohol, and recent seizures presented to ED with
changes in mental status and respiratory failure.

Brought to ED for change in mental status and soon after arrival
found to be cyanotic with sat 46% on room air, RR 6. The
patient's methadone dose had recently been increased secondary
to an interaction with dilantin.  The week prior to
presentation, the patient had developed a rash with the dilantin
and was switched to Keppra; however, the methadone dose had not
be reduced.  In the ED she was given narcane and was aroused but
was aggressive and required 4 point restraints.  She then became
somnolent again and was in respiratory distress, requirng
intubation and sedation. Prior to intubation her blood pressure
was 190/110.  For this she was started on a nitroglycerin drip
and post intubation started on propofol drip. She then became
hypotensive with systolic blood pressure in the 60s. The NTG was
stopped but BP did not resolve. Pt with 18 of auto-PEEP likely
contributing, and dehydrated with CVP 18. Inital blood gas on AC
vent settings of fio2 50%, PEEP 5, TV 550, rr 20 was 7.31/51/90.
She was treated with IVFs with no improvement in pressure. She
was given dopamine but would not tolerate due to tachycardia
with sinus tach and also SVT vs Aflutter.  She was then
transfered to the ICU.  CXR at that time showed bilateral
pulmonary infiltrates, hyperinflation, pulmonary artery
congestion.
Previous work-up includes:
ECHO [**10-12**]: EF 55% symmetric mild LVH. No valvular dz.

Brief Hospital Course:
49F with history of Hepatitis C infection with cirrhosis, COPD,
seizures secondary to reversible leukoencephalopathy diagnosed
[**10-12**], and history of IVDU currently on methadone maintenance who
presented with respiratory depression secondary to COPD
exacerbation and nonintentional methadone overdose secondary to
drug-drug interactions resulting in hypoxic and hypercarbic
respiratory failure. During hospitalization the following
problems were addressed:
1. Respiratory Failure - Etiology for intial resp failure was
likely secondary to sedation from narcotic overdose in setting
of severe COPD. Given CXR, there was also likely a component of
flash pulmonary edema. The patient improved and was called out
to floor on [**11-24**], but returned to the MICU with lethargy and
decreased respiratory rate within two hours. She had received
methadone 50mg PO that morning.  She was continued on nebulizer
treatments for COPD exacerbation.  Methadone was dosed 20mg [**Hospital1 **]
x1 day, then 30mg QAM, 10mg QPM, then 40mg daily, which she
tolerated without evidence of oversedation or withdrawal.  She
was also treated with a week course of doxycycline for COPD
exacerbation.
3. Methadone Maintenance: methadone was dosed as described
above.  On the day prior to discharge, the patient developed
some agitation and elevated BP, SBP 150, which may have been a
withdrawal symptoms, but may also have been attributable to
anxiety or her nicotine patch.  She was without signs of
withdrawal on the day of discharge.
4. Hypotension:  The patient became hypotensive in the ED
requiring 7L IVFs, and BP normalized.  She received a stress
dose of steroids in the MICU, was changed to solumedrol, and
then tapered off on a short course of prednisone.  Blood
pressure stabilized, and on the day prior to discharge she
became hypertensive with SBP 150.  She was treated with
lopressor 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].  In discuss, Her primary care provider
expressed concern about beta-blocker causing a COPD
exacerbation, and she was discharged to home on 12.5mg HCTZ.
She will follow-up with her PCP regarding blood pressure
control.
5. Seizures:  The patient has a history of recent onset of
seizures due to reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy.  She
was maintained on Keppra without any seizure activity.  She had
been discharged previously on Dilantin.  She then developed a
rash, presented to the ER, and was prescribed Keppra 500mg daily
to be increased to twice daily after two weeks.  She was
discharged to home on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **], which she tolerated
during the hospitalization.  It was thought that her methadone
dose had been increased due to drug-drug interaction with
dilantin.  When she switched to Keppra, the dose of methadone
was not reduced accordingly, causing this overdose episode.
6.  Abdominal pain:  The patient noted RUQ extending to
mid-epigastric pain to palpation on exam when transferred to the
floor.  An ultrasound revealed gallbladder wall thickening and
edema, but not cholelithiasis.  She was afebrile and without any
nausea.  Surgery was consulted and felt the inflammation was due
to her chronic hepatic disease, and not an acute cholecystitis.
Liver function tests and pancreatic function tests remained
normal.  The pain was likely muscular due to coughing, or may
have been due to the small pleural effusion bilateral noted on
CXR, thought to be due to the heavy IVF load she received.  The
improved by the time of discharge such that there was pain with
deep palpation, with movement and coughing, but none at rest.
7.  Dispo:  She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 978**], PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
in [**Hospital 3585**] clinic, and with the methadone clinic.  She was
provided with a letter for the methadone clinic stating what she
received regarding opioid treatment.  She is a full code.

Brief Hospital Course:
AP: 46 yo M with hx of IDDM with DKA & sepsis, initially
intubted on pressors and admitted to the ICU for further care
and management.

1. Respiratory failure/MRSA pneumonia:  Patient was initially
placed on broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin,
ceftriaxone, and flagyl for hypotension in the setting of DKA.
A sputum culture was obtained that grew out MRSA.  He was
continued on vanc for a total 10 day course.  All blood cultures
taken at our hospital were negative.  He was sucessfully weaned
off of mechanical ventilation and then diuresed with resulting
return to baseline function and no oxygen requirement.  At the
time of discharge the patient had resolved leukocytosis and was
afebrile with a markedly improved CXR.
2. DKA: Patient was initially placed on an insulin gtt per
protocol and was followed with serial chem 10s and ABGs until
his anion gap closed.  He was then transitioned to Lantus and a
humalog sliding scale.  Patient initially had early morning
hypoglycemia on a dose of Lantus 20 units daily and this was
decreased to 16 units.  However the patient's BG then was
consistently in the mid 200s.  In consultation with [**Last Name (un) **] DM
management team who have been following the pt during this
hospitalization it was decided to increase the lantus dose to 18
units daily and titrate the humalog scale.  He has follow up
appointments with [**Last Name (un) **] on [**8-19**].

3. Thrombocytopenia: Patient had transient thrombocytopenia
while in the ICU that resolved prior to transfer to the floor.
A HIT-Ab was sent which was negative.  He had no evidence of
petechiae or easy bruising.

4. Skin lesions: S/p fluid overload & edema with blisters.  He
was followed by the wound consult nurse and had dressing changes
daily.  There were no signs of ceullulitis at these sites.  He
will have VNA follow up at home for continued dressing changes.
.
5. ARF: Patient experienced ARF on admission most likely
secondary to profound volume depletion.  He was aggressively
hydrated with IVF and his serum cr returned to baseline upon
arrival to the general floor.

6. Depression--Pt was placed back on his prior dose of Celexa.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Patient is a 22 year old female with SLE, lupus nephritis,
ESRD on HD who presents with hypertensive urgency.
.
# Hypertensive urgency - Unclear precipitant.  Possibly
secondary to pain from worsening uveitis.  Compliant with meds.
Denies illicits and tox screen negative. Patient was started on
labetolol drip in ED with good BP response and was subsequently
transitioned to PO anti-hypertensives in ICU with maintenance of
stable SBPs in 150s-170s (baseline 170s-190s).  Per
nephrologist's recommendations, home lisinopril was increased to
40 mg po bid from 40 mg po qd for better baseline BP control.
No clinical evidence of end organ damage (UA difficult ro
interpret in setting of CRF).  CE's x 1 negative.
.
# Headache - No evidence by CT for intracranial bleed.
Headaches were well controlled with morphine sulfate and had
resolved by time of discharge.
.
# Uveitis - Followed by outpatient optho specialist.  Optho not
consulted per patient's request.
.
# ESRD - Secondary to lupus nephritis.  On transplant list.
Patient received hemodialysis in house with 500 ml ultrafiltrate
without complications.  At dry weight of 45 kg per patient.
Began Sevalamer 800 TID with meals.  Given difficulty in
interpreting renin and aldosterone levels in acutely ill
patients, these were not drawn and will need to be drawn at
outpatient follow up.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 45 year-old man wtih a
history of narcotic and benzodiazepine abuse status post
multiple attempts to detox who decided three days ago to stop
all of his narcotics and benzodiazepines, because he was
tired of being dependent on these medications.  The patient
[**Hospital6 17459**] on [**4-28**] who
placed him on a combination of medications for withdraw.  The
patient saw this physician again on the day of admission in
his office, checked a tox screen with a urine screen negative
for narcotic and gave him a test dose of Naltrexone by mouth
[**2-22**] of a 50 mg tablet at 1:00 p.m.  Twenty minutes later the
patient became acutely confused, agitated, hypertensive,
without back pain and without headache.  On further
questioning the patient admitted to taking one Percocet
earlier on the day of admission.  In the Emergency Room the
patient's blood pressure was 220/100 with a pulse of 127,
respirations 28, very agitated and placed on four point
restraints.  The patient received 8 mg of Ativan and 111 mg
of morphine over a several hour period with improvement in
his mental status and diminishment of his blood pressure to
166/110 and his pulse was diminished to 97.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  One half pack per day of smoking times 17
years, occasional alcohol, history of intravenous drug abuse,
no cocaine.  The patient was disabled with past profession as
a boxer.  He lives with his fiance.

MEDICATIONS AT ADMISSION PRIOR TO [**4-28**]:  The patient was
taking Percocet 7.5 mg tablets prn roughly 120 tablets per
month, Fentanyl patch 100 micrograms for the last seven
years, Xanax 1.5 mg b.i.d. for the last seven years, Prozac
and Tums.  After seeing the withdraw specialist the patient
was on Neurontin 1600 mg q.i.d., Robaxin 750 mg t.i.d.,
Celebrex 200 mg q.d., Quinine 260 mg b.i.d., Baclofen 20 mg
b.i.d., Ambien 10 to 20 mg q.h.s., Librium 25 mg q.i.d.,
Valium 10 mg q.o.d., Risperdal 1 mg prn, Clonidine 0.1 mg
patch q week, Doxepin 100 mg q.h.s., Tizanidine 4 mg q.h.s.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 166/110.
Heart rate 97.  The patient is [**Age over 90 **]% on room air.  Pupils were
3 mm equal and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Oropharynx was clear.  JVP was difficult to
evaluate. Neck was supple.  The patient had a regular rate
and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was obese, well
healed midline scar, diffuse tenderness, no edema.  2+ pedal
pulses. The patient had a nonfocal cranial nerves examination
with cranial nerves II through XII intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially observed in the
MICU for signs of acute withdraw and management of the
patient's hypertension.  The patient was started on 60 mg of
intravenous morphine prn signs of withdraw q 6 hours.  The
patient was also given up to 4 mg of po Ativan q 4 to 6
hours.  The patient was weaned aggressively off these
narcotics and was followed by the toxicology service who
recommended keeping him on short acting agents for 72 hours
after his ingestion due to the 72 hour duration of
Spironolactone in the circulation.  Therefore long acting
agents were discouraged and not used in this patient although
the patient did get one dose of methadone prior to this
decision being made.  The patient was weaned off of his
intravenous medications and switched to oral.  At the time of
discharge the patient was receiving 30 mg of MSIR q 6 hours
prn and 2 mg po Ativan q 6 hours prn.  On the day prior to
discharge the patient got 10 mg total of po Ativan and
roughly 120 mg po of MSIR.  The plan was to continue to wean
these medications completely off with acute inpatient detox
patient.  The patient had been followed by social work,
psychiatry, toxicology and general medicine.  All services
agreed that the patient would require inpatient
detoxification.  An outpatient taper was discussed, however,
the patient's narcotic requirements were too high for any of
the physicians involved in his care to feel comfortable
prescribing him with medications.  Also it was thought that
he should be receiving these medications and this
detoxification under an observed setting with administration
of these medications by a third party.  The patient was
agitated throughout his hospitalization, but on the last 48
hours of his hospitalization showed no objective signs of
withdraw.  The patient was normotensive.  The patient had no
signs of tachycardia.  The patient's pupils remained normal
with normal reactivity at the last day of admission.  The
patient was afebrile throughout his hospitalization.  The
patient was combative at times, but was never physically
aggressive or threatening.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 84176**] is a 25yo woman with history of anxiety and heroin
abuse who was found apneic and unresponsive.

Ms. [**Known lastname 84176**] has a long history of heroin abuse, which she usually
takes intranasally.  After two weeks of sobriety, she relapsed
today and decided to take heroin IV around 1:30pm.  She was in
the company of two other heroin users, who noticed sometime
later that she was unresponsive and not breathing.  They called
EMS; by report, her oxygen sat was in the 50s when they arrived.
 She responded well to 1mg of IV narcan, and was taken to the
ED.

Of note, she admits to snorting some cocaine earlier in the day.
 She attributes her relapse to uncontrolled anxiety as she has
been unable to get a regular Rx for xanax since she has no PCP
and no health insurance.  In fact, she reports multiple
admissions to [**Hospital1 2025**], [**Hospital1 112**], and [**Hospital 2079**] Hospital for seizures
after missing her xanax doses.  According to what she has been
told by witnesses, she falls down, loses consciousness, and
begins shaking all over.  +Bladder incontinence and tongue
biting.  She was most recently seen in the ED at [**Hospital1 112**] and still
has some of the xanax pills with her from that ED stay.

In the ED, initial VS were:  98.0   93/56   96   16   98%.  She
was initially conversant.  Labs and EKG were normal apart from
mild hyperglycemia.  CXR was read as normal.  During her stay in
the ED, she became increasingly drowsy with slowing of her
respirations, and so she was given an additional dose of narcan.
 When her second dose of 1mg IV narcan started to wear off, the
team decided to start her on a narcan gtt at 1.5mg/hr.  She was
evaluated by psychiatry, who felt that it was appropriate to
keep her under section 12.  She received 2mg of xanax prior to
transfer.

Upon arrival to the ICU, she was somewhat anxious but awake and
talkative.  Her narcan gtt is finishing.

On review of systems, she reports episodes of diarrhea that she
thinks may be related to withdrawal from heroin in the past.
She states that her father pushed her when he was drunk recently
and since then her left shoulder has been hurting.

Past Medical History:
Anxiety with h/o Panic Attacks and Cutting Behaviors
Heroin abuse, maintained on suboxone in the past
h/o seizures from benzodiazepine withdrawal per patient's report
Tobacco Abuse
Cocaine Abuse -- snorts

Brief Hospital Course:
25yo woman admitted with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in
the setting of heroin use.

# Hypoxic respiratory failure:
Secondary to impaired respiratory drive in setting of heroin
use.  No evidence of pulmonary edema, acute lung injury, or
pneumonia on CXR.  Patient remained on a narcan drip overnight
after admission due to somnolence and decreasing respiratory
rate.  She was taken off it it the morning of [**11-21**] and did well.

# Heroin overdose and abuse:  Addictions consult was ordered.
ICU team felt that patient was unlikely to develop withdrawal
given reported opiate sobriety for the two weeks prior to
overdose.  However, while admitted to the ICU, the patient
surreptitiously used heroin intranasally and became intoxicated.
 She admitted to this heroin use after questioning and a cavity
search revealed one small packet of heroin and 10-15 tablets of
xanax (per patient).

# Benzodiazepine / Reported h/o Seizures:  Pt. was on CIWA scale
at first but as this was not required, it was d/c'd.  The
medical team did not feel that xanax was appropriate except on
an as needed basis and no other medications were provided.

# Anxiety and poor Judgment:  Recent behavior has demonstrated
that patient's choices put her at risk for harm.  Psychiatry was
consulted and patient was given section 12.  Had a 1:1 sitter
and she is being sent to [**Hospital1 **] 4 for psychiatric inpatient
care on discharge.

# Left clavicle chip: Chronic fracture and changes.  Does have
mild AC joint strain.

# Poor access to health care system:
No PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] health insurance.  Per nursing staff, admitting works
to establish Mass Health.  Provided number for [**Company 191**] for d/c
appointment for discharge facility to make an appointment.

# Concern for unsafe home situation:

Micro:
Blood Cx- [**12-18**]: No growth
Urine Cx- [**12-18**]: No growth

[**12-18**] TTE
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. A
possible secundum type atrial septal defect is seen by color
Doppler (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]) There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function. There is no significant resting LVOT gradient, but a
mild gradient (30mmHg peak) is seen with Valsalva manuever.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Marked symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal regional/global systolic function and mild inducible LVOT
gradient. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Possible secundum type atrial septal
defect.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-10-19**], a
possible secundum type atrial septal defect is now suggested.
If clinically indicated, a follow-up study with saline contrast
and/or a TEE would be better able to characterize the possible
atrial septal defect.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2140**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

[**12-18**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. Cardiomegaly with findings suggestive of mild pulmonary
edema.
2. Bibasilar linear opacities suggesting atelectasis, although
developing
pneumonia cannot be excluded.
3. No evidence of free intraperitoneal air.

[**12-20**] MRV
IMPRESSION:
No appreciable change since the MRV chest exam dated [**2141-5-30**]. SVC is
patent. Again seen is occlusion of the right internal jugular
and left
brachiocephalic veins. Right external jugular vein is provides
the major
venous drainage from the neck.


Brief Hospital Course:
24 year old Female with SLE, ESRD on HD and malignant
hypertension presents with abdominal pain and headache
consistent with her usual hypertensive urgency and was found to
be in hypertensive urgency in ED.

1. Malignant Hypertension:  The patient had her hemodialysis two
days prior to admission. Initially in the ED her BP was 253/170.
She was given 10mg IV Labetalol and started on a labatelol drip.
She also received hydralazine IV 10 mg once and 2 inches of
nitropaste. She had morphine 4mg and 4mg Zofran for nausea. Her
BP remained elevated so she was switched to nicardipine
1mg/kg/min. The patient was transferred to the MICU. In the ICU
she was continued on the Nicardapine drip and her pressures
decreased to 175/120. Nephrology was consulted and dialysis
initiated in the AM. The Nicardapine drip dc'd on [**12-19**] and pt
transferred to floor.

While on the floor the patient had question of angioedema and
markedly elevated BP. She was readmitted to the MICU on
[**2141-12-20**].  Patient's Aliskerin was also held for conern for
angioedema.  The renal team removed her tunneled dialysis
catheter that had a cuff out, and replaced it with a temporary
femoral line. The patient's PD catheter was removed. The patient
was briefly on a nitro drip for hypertension. The patient's
nifedepine was increased to 120mg. The patient was transferred
to the floor with stable blood pressures, BP 124/72 on [**12-21**].

The morning of [**12-22**], the patient was noted to have a BP up to
247/120 at 0800. Hypertension persisted throughout the morning
with BPs 210s-240s systolic. HR during this time was in the 90s.
She received a total of 60 mg IV hydralazine over the course of
the morning as well as 0.1 mg PO clonidine. She was also given
her normal AM BP meds and restarted on aliskarin. Due to
persistent hypertension, she was transferred to the ICU for
further care.

On arrival to the ICU, the patient reported severe abdominal
pain over the site of recently removed PD catheter. She denied
any headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or lower
extremity swelling. She reports bilateral calf cramping but no
leg swelling. She denies any difficulty breathing or chest pain.
She took her AM BP meds without difficulty. Her blood pressure
decreased to 130s-140s/60s without further intervention. She was
transferred back to the floor on [**12-23**] and signed out AMA.

2. Angioedema:
On [**12-20**] the patietn developed facial swelling and evidence of
angioedema by ENT. The patient reported that her face is more
swollen which was confirmed by her mother on the floor. The
patient was give lasix IV as she has been unable to have any
negative filtration with HD. The patient was started on decadron
10mg q8hr, famotidine, diphenhydramine for the edema. Her
tekturna was discontinued  for concern that it might be causing
angioedema. She denied difficulty with her breathing at that
time, but was very somnulent. On arrival to the MICU her vitals
were stable and oxygenating well at 100% on face mask.  The
patient's airway was supported with a nasal trumpet. The patient
underwent MRV that showed no progression of her clot. Patient
was diuresed with lasix and dialysis with significant
improvement in her symptoms. She was treated with prednisone and
decadron, famotidine and benadryl for angioedema. The patient
was maintained on her heparin drip for her SVC syndrome.

3. Abdominal Pain: The patient has had extensive prior workup
that has been unrevealing. The Transplant surgery team removed
the PD cath on [**12-21**]. She continued to have abdominal pain
post-op.  She was continued on PO dilaudid 2mg po prn.  She
continuned to complain of abdominal pain throughout her
admission and continued to requested IV dilaudid.

4. ESRD: The patient is on a T/Th/Sat schedule.  She was closely
followed by the renal team.  She had dialysis on [**12-19**]. The
patient's tunneled dialysis catheter  had a cuff that was out
and qas subsequently replaced with a temporary femoral line on
[**12-21**].  The patient also had her PD catheter removed on [**12-21**]
secondary to chronic abdominal pain.  The patient was scheduled
to have dialysis on [**12-23**].

5. Hx of SVC/brachiocephalic DVT: Her coumadin was held during
last admission for supratherapeutic INR. She was admitted with a
subtherpeutic INR of 1.2  She was started on a heparin drip. She
was also started on Coumadin 2mg PO qday, but was held on [**12-19**]
in prep her PD catheter removal. She was continuned on the
heparin drip and her coumadin continued to be held in
preparation for placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter by IR.
However, the patient signed out AMA and thus it was not placed.


6. Anxiety: Pt recently saw psychiatrist who started her on
Celexa. She was continued on Celexa 20mg PO daily.

7. Anemi of CKDa: The patient's Hct was 30.3 on admission.  It
trended down to 22.3 on discharge when she left AMA.  There was
no evidence of active, acute bleeding.  THis is likely seoncdary
to her ESRD. The patient was closely monitored.

8. Systemic Lupus Erythematosis: Rheumatology was consulted and
does not suspect acute flare and dsDNA, C3, C4 nl, ESR and CRP
slightly elevated. Her Echo did not suggest worsening
pericarditis.  She was continued on her home prednisone dose of
4mg daily.

9. Obstructive Sleep Apnea: CPAP for sleep with 7 pressure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Intentional overdose/suicide attempt: Mr. [**Known lastname 75707**] presented
with a suicide attempt with benzodiazepines, penicillin and
morphine, in the context of severe social stressors.  Negative
toxicology screen is difficult to interpret given the time
course of the ingestion.  He was admitted to the ICU and
observed.  He was hemodynamically stable without electrolyte
abnormalities or EKG abnormalities.   Psychiatry was consulted
and given suicidal ideation attempt recommended inpatient
psychiatric hospitalization.  He was placed on a section 12 and
had a 1:1 sitter while here.  He was continued on home celexa
.
Hypertension:  Mildly hypertensive in the ICU.  Was not taking
his antihypertensives at home.  His home Toprol and HCTZ have
been restarted.
.
Pseudoseizures:  Well documented in neurology notes.  He did
have two episodes of seizure like activity, first in the
ambulance and subsequently in the ED on transport to the ICU.
He received a dose of ativan IV, and was continued on his home
topamax.  He subsequently had 2 more episodes on the floor,
after learning that he would require psychiatric
hospitalization.  He was able to perform commands while the
seizure was going on, which adds to the diagnosis of
non-electrical seizures.  He should follow up with his
neurologist on discharge from the psychiatric facility.

History of Present Illness:
50 year old woman with PMH of COPD with multiple previous
intubations, IV drug use now on methadone, hepatitis C, seizure
disorder, and tobacco abuse presents with increasing shortness
of breath over last day. She reports an associated cough with
yellow/greenish sputum. She also had a migraine headache,
similar to her usual migraines, associated with nausea and
vomiting. She denies fevers, chills. She reports a history of
smoke exposure 2 days prior to prenetation when she was staying
with her sister who fell asleep with a cigarette, causing her
pillow to smoke and her apartment to fill with smoke.
On presentation to the ED her O2 sat was 67% but improved to 92%
on 2 liters of oxygen. ABG's demonstrated acidemia with
hypercarbia, and she was placed on CPAP and vomited. CXR was
grossly clear. Repeat ABG was 7.19/96/19 so she was intubated to
improve oxygenation and ventilation. Her BP dropped to 70-80's
systolic post intubation as during previous intubations so a
femoral line was placed and she was given 4 liters of NS. She
was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory support.

CXR ([**2183-4-9**]): PA AND LATERAL CHEST: There has been interval
extubation. The lungs are hyperinflated. The diaphragms are
flattened and the retrosternal clear space is increased. There
is no focal air space consolidation. There is no effusion. There
is some linear atelectasis at both lung bases. There is no
pneumothorax. IMPRESSION: Interval extubation without focal air
space consolidation to represent pneumonia or aspiration. No
CHF.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 46780**] was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], for a short course,
because of hypercarbic respiratory failure from a COPD
exacerbation. She required a short course of intubation and
mechanical ventiliation. Thereafter, she recovered to baseline
with steroids, nebulizers, and levofloxacin.

1) Resp Distress/COPD: Again, she had hypercarbic failure and
was initially intubated for a COPD exacerbation. Her CXR showed
only right basilar atelectasis and emphysema. An initial sputum
gram stain had 4+ GNRs but the subsequent culture was negative.
She initialyl had leukocytosis, but this also imprvoved. She was
given albuterol and atroven nebulizers and was transitioned from
solumedrol to a Prednisone taper. She was started on
Levofloxacin for a ten day course. Baseline PFTs were obtained,
but the results (which showed somewhat preserved lung volumes,
with marked decrease of her FEV1 and FEV1/FVC and DLCO) may not
have represented a true baseline given her resolving acute
pulmonary process. She was discharged with Pulmonary follow-up
and was given extensive counseling on smoking cessation - she
was started on Nicotine replacement.

2) Hypotension: Of note, the patient had a short episode of
hypotension in the ED after intubation. This responded to fluid
boluses. Her blood pressure was stable thereafter.

History of Present Illness:
47 year old female with PMH of depression presented from an OSH
after being found unresponsive at home with empty bottles of
whiskey, temazepam, risperdal, prozac, clonazepam, and percocet.
Patient has a ~20 year history of depression that, according to
her husband, has been well controlled. Within the past few years
she has stated paranoid ideations and was started on risperdal,
which she has not taken for over 1 year. Husband noticed a
change in her behavior approximately 1 month ago, coinciding
with worsening health status of her mother. [**Name (NI) 4906**] denies any
history of suicidal thoughts or attempts. Per husband's and
daughter's report, the patient was carrying furniture into her
home after midnight. The husband reports he yelled at her,
saying she needs to see a doctor. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 25896**], the
daughter found her with the empty bottles. She was responsive at
this time, though her speech was slurred and incoherent. She
became unresponsive within 2-3 minutes. Daughter found her
sitting upright and does not believe she had fallen or suffered
any head trauma.

Patient was initally taken to [**Hospital3 **]. Vitals on arrival
were BP 103/48, HR 91, O2Sat 98% on 15L, RR 10. She was
subsequently intubated and eventually transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
because the CT machine was not functioning at OSH.

Brief Hospital Course:
47 year old female with a history of depression, hyperlipidemia
with intentional multiple drug overdose, including EtOH,
benzodiazepines, acetaminophen, and opioids.
.
> MULTIPLE DRUG OVERDOSE / SUICIDE ATTEMPT: initial treatment
for her mental status depression and impending respiratory
failure was intubation and activated charcoal.  She had serial
EKGs without QTc prolongation or QRS prolongation.  Her tylenol
level was elevated at 13.8- likely within 6 hours of ingestion -
but this could not be confirmed. She had a slight elevation in
her transaminases so she was given a 4 hour load of NAC and then
a continuous 16 hour infusion.  Over time while intubated her
medication overdose seemed to have cleared, her mental status
improved, and she was extubated successfully.  She was
transferred to the Hospital Medicine Service and eventually
medically cleared from an overdose standpoint. She was
transferred to Psychiatry for inpatient psychiatric management.
.
>ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA: she was treated empirically with Zosyn
3.375.  This was switched to clindamycin for presumed aspiration
pneumonia.  While intubated she had endotracheal sputum cultures
that grew gram + cocci in pairs and clusters.  It was thought
this may have been a contaminant or colonizer.  She was
extubated successfully and was transferred to the General
Medical floor, where her respiratory status was stable off
supplemental oxygen.  Her antibiotic regimen was changed to oral
levofloxacin to complete a 5 day course. Sputum cultures were
confirmed to be MSSA, also sensitive to levofloxacin.

.
Imaging:
[**2168-2-12**] CHEST X-RAY:
FINDINGS: The lung volumes are normal. The patient is intubated,
the tube is  projecting with its tip approximately 8 mm above
the carina and should be pulled back by approximately 1-2 cm.
Normal course of the nasogastric tube. The tube, however, ends
in the proximal part of the stomach and could be advanced by
approximately 5 cm. No parenchymal changes. No pulmonary edema.
No focal parenchymal opacities. Normal size of the cardiac
silhouette. Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.
.
[**2168-2-16**] CHEST X-RAY:
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with
patient in
supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding
similar study of [**2168-2-12**]. The patient is now
extubated. Heart size is within normal limits considering
patient's position. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.
No signs of new acute parenchymal infiltrates are present, and
the lateral pleural sinuses remain free. No pneumothorax
identified. In comparison with the next preceding study of
[**2-12**], the patient has been extubated. The findings on
this single chest view are within normal limits and thus there
is no radiographic evidence of acute infection.

Brief Hospital Course:
30 year old man with a history of heroine abuse (most recent use
[**2168-2-10**]), who presented to an OSH after being found down at
home, found to have rhabdomyolosis and compartment syndrome of
the LUE and LLE s/p decompressive fasciotomies, complicated by
LUE cellulitis.
.
# Compartment syndrome: Found down in the bathtub after several
hours. Complained of left upper and lower extremity pain. CK
found to be [**Numeric Identifier 26361**], consistent with rhabdomyolysis. Patient was
fluid resuscitated and his creatinine and urine output remained
stable. Elevated pressures in both left-sided extremities so
patient underwent fasciotomies on [**2-11**]. On [**2-15**] underwent
I&D/closure of left thigh and I&D/VAC of left forearm with later
incomlete closure of incision and vac placement. On [**2168-2-23**]
underwent complete closure of LUE fasciotomy incision. He is
currently weight bearing on both his left upper extremity and
left lower extremity and has been working with PT. We have been
controlling his pain with methadone, MS Contin, and dilaudid. He
was placed on Lovenox given his high DVT risk.
.
# Rhabdomyolysis: Muscle breakdown after immobility without
renal dysfunction. CK and LFTs trended down and creatinine has
been stable at 0.8 with good urine output.
.
# LUE incision cellulitis: Had I&D/closure of LUE on [**2168-2-23**]
and soon after developed an area of erythema surrounding the
incision, despite being on cephalexin. The patient was switched
to Vancomycin for MRSA coverage, with improvement in the
cellulitis (borders are outlined). The vancomycin was
transitioned to Linezolid on [**2-24**] for easier administration and
should complete a 10-day course (ending [**3-4**]).
.
# Pain control: Patient is currently on methadone 5mg Q8h, MS
Contin 60mg Q12, and dilaudid prn for breakthrough pain. The MS
Contin was increased from 30mg Q12 to 60mg Q12 on [**2-24**] for better
pain control.
.
# Withdrawal: Patient was noted to be quite tremulous on POD#1
after extubation. At baseline, patient takes in 1-2g heroin and
15mg xanax daily. Patient was started on clonidine, standing
diazepam, and an ativan CIWA scale to manage his symptoms. We
have been weaning him off the clonidine and diazepam and he is
currently on clonidine 0.1mg [**Hospital1 **] and diazepam 2mg Q8h. Pt
reports a history of mutiple overdoses and would like to enrol
in a detox progam.
.
# Fluid accumulation lower abdomen/upper thighs: Has been
urinating over 4.5/day on his own. He has been encouraged to get
out of bed to the chair to improve fluid accumulation on lower
abdomen and upper thighs from being lying in bed.
.
# Hepatitis C: Pt was given info from the CDC (print out for
patients) regarding the disease. He will need outpatient follow
up.
.
# Disposition: Patient is being discharged to a rehabilitation
facility in order to undergo aggressive PT/OT. He will also need
help regarding his substance abuse.

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory arrest

This is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history of
transverse myelitis, asthma who presented to the Emergency
Department for evaluation of muscle spasms and cough.  The
patient was in the usual state of health until the night
prior to admission after he, per his brother's report, had an
episode of choking and aspiration at the dinner table.  The
next morning, the morning of admission, the patient had cough
and increased muscle spasms, including his lower extremities
and chest, as well as increased difficulty breathing.  This
prompted the patient's family to take him to the Emergency
Department, where he was found to have extra two fentanyl
patches.  Per his wife's report, the patient is taking two
100 mg fentanyl patches, however on the morning of admission,
he forgot to remove two and so he had four patches at the
time of admission to the Emergency Department.

The patient was evaluated by Emergency Department personnel
and it was felt that he was oversedated from narcotics and
therefore the patient was given Narcan which lead to
increased agitation and difficulty to control the patient in
the department.  In order to sedate him, he was given Ativan
and morphine.  Lopressor was given as well, however his blood
pressure continued to fall.  The patient became non
responsive and was intubated and transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.

Chest x-ray on admission was consistent with right lower lobe
pneumonia and Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**] was started on clindamycin and
ceftriaxone for presumed aspiration pneumonia.  In the unit,
the patient continued to improve and was extubated on [**6-10**] and transferred to the floor on [**6-12**].  His asthma
was treated with nebulizers, albuterol and Atrovent.  He was
receiving Neurontin, Baclofen for transverse myelitis.  His
blood pressures were within normal range.  On [**6-13**], the
patient's sputum cultures came back positive for pseudomonas
and his antibiotics were changed from ceftriaxone to Zosyn.
On [**6-14**], the patient developed difficulty breathing.  At
midnight, he was saturating 93% on 100% nonrebreather mask
with respiratory rate of 40.  He became visibly tachypneic,
anxious.  His arterial blood gas was obtained and was
significant for PCO2 38, PO2 56, pH 7.50 and the patient was
transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, he was not intubated, but
was started on CPAP which adequately maintained oxygen
saturations above 92%.  His treatment for pseudomonas
pneumonia was double coverage with ceftazidime in addition to
Zosyn.  The patient continued to improve and was transferred
back to the floor on [**6-18**].  On the floor, he was seen by
psychiatry and his pain medication regimen was reevaluated.
Valium was taken off the regimen.  Instead, risperidone was
added and then gradually tapered down to 2 mg po q hs.

Pulmonary wise, Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**] continued to improve on Zosyn and
ceftazidime, however on [**6-20**] he developed a rash which
was thought to be secondary to antibiotics.  His Zosyn was
stopped and he was started on Tobramycin.  He received
physical therapy and chest therapy, as well as nebulizer
therapy during his stay in the unit and on the floor.

His neurological and pain symptoms seemed to be well
controlled with risperidone, Paxil, diazepam and Demerol for
breakthrough pain.  He also received Baclofen for neurogenic
bladder and gabapentin for pain.

Hematologically, Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**]' hematocrit decreased down to
26.6.  The patient was offered a blood transfusion, however
Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**] decided not to consent.  His hematocrit remained
low, but stable and went up to 33.1 prior to the discharge.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**] received daily doses of Coumadin because of the
history of deep venous thrombosis.  His INR upon transfer to
the floor was 5.20 and remained at this value for the next
few days.  He received 2.5 mg of vitamin K on [**6-20**] and
his INR went up to 1.1.  His Coumadin dose was increased to
5.0 prior to discharge.  He was also given subcutaneous
heparin 5000 units q 12 hours for adequate deep venous
thrombosis prophylaxis.

Gastrointestinal - the patient continued on his bowel
regimen.  He received disimpactions as needed.  He had bowel
movements every one to two days.

At the time of this dictation, the plan was for the patient
to go home with services on the following medications:
1.  Heparin subcutaneous 5000 units q 12
2.  Iron polysaccharides complex 150 mg po qd
3.  Tobramycin 120 mg intravenous q8h for three days
4.  Risperidone 2 mg po q hs
5.  Warfarin 5 mg po qd
6.  Simethicone 80 mg po tid
7.  Paroxetine 40 mg po qd
8.  Trazodone 50 mg po q hs prn for insomnia
9.  Senna 2 tablets po bid
10. Docusate 200 mg po bid
11. Pantoprazole 40 mg po qd
12. ........... 10 mg po qd
13. Theophylline 400 mg po q a.m.
14. Gabapentin 400 mg q a.m. and 600 mg q hs
15. Baclofen 10 mg po tid
16. Ceftazidine 1 gm intravenous q8h for three days
17. Fentanyl patch 100 mcg transcutaneous patch every 48
hours
18. Bisacodyl 10 mg pr [**Hospital1 **] prn
19. Atorvastatin 20 mg po qd
20. Levothyroxine 50 milliequivalents po qd

The patient was to be discharged to home in good condition on
[**6-24**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Respiratory arrest secondary to narcotic overdose
2.  Aspiration pneumonia

The patient is a 49M with medical history of type I diabetes,
narcotics abuse, hypertension presented to [**Hospital3 **]hospital on [**2129-11-18**] after several day history of nausea and
vomiting. Per the wife who had spoken with him over phone daily
prior to hospitalization, he had been sick to his stomach on
Wednesday and thursday with poor po intake. He sounded confused
and short of breath on the phone. Not clear if fever or chills
or diarrhea. Of note, the patient obtained a perocet rx on
wednesday [**11-16**] for #30 tablets that was supposed to last 10
days but by Friday all the tablets were gone (of note two weeks
prior very depressed, sent to [**Hospital1 **]? psychiatric unit, from

pneumonia, or both. CT head with no abnormality except for air
fluid level in maxillary sinus consistent with sinusitis. He was
given ceftriaxone and azithromycin for suspected pneumonia,
insulin gtt and 2L IVF and admitted to the ICU.
.
The patient was maintained on an insulin gtt until his anion gap
closed after which he was transitioned on [**2129-11-19**] to his daily
lantus and insulin sliding scale with FS in 200s. He developed
worsening respiratory distress with repeat ABG showing hypoxemic
respiratory failure with PO2 of 35 and was intubated on
[**2129-11-19**]. Chest x-ray reported showed pulmonary edema and he was
given lasix 40mg IVx2 with good response. Looks like antibiotics
changed from ceftriaxone/azithro to levaquin on [**11-20**]. Vent
settings on tranfer AC TV 400, 65% FiO2, PEEP 10. Today temp of

Urine legionella was negative. Stool for C.dif toxins was
negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
49M with history of type I diabetes, hypertension presented with
nausea found to be in DKA, hypoxic respiratory failure likely
secondary to pneumonia and course complicated by DKA who was
initially admitted to the ICU.
.
#HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  CXR on admission equivocal for
multifocal PNA vs. pleural effusions. He has been treated for
both with antibiotics (broadened to vancomycin, zosyn, and
azithromycin) as well as IV lasix diuresis complicated by
hypernatremia.  TTE showing preserved EF and therefore unlikely
to be cardiogenic.. Patient was successfully extubated and
tolerated room air/NC well,with no tachypnea and oxygen
saturations above 95%. Continued HCAP tx with vanc, zosyn X 7
days , azithromycin X 5 days. ubsequently extubated and
transferred to the medical floor where he was observed for
another two days and started physiotherapy. On discharge patient
respiratory status is improved with normal oxygen saturations.
Will need repeat CXR 6 weeks following discharge.
.
#.ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Patient mental status post extubation
remained altered in the ICU where he was was slow in answering
questions, slept for prolonged amounts of time alternating with
episodes of agitation. This was attributed to prolomnged effect
of sedatives he was receiving during intubation. Mental status
on the medical floor was back at baseline and zyprexa was
discontuinued.
.
# DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS: Presented with DKA likely secondary to
infection. Was followed in the ICU by [**Last Name (un) **], initially treated
with Insullin gtt then after Anion gap closed transitioned to
lantus + insulin sliding scale.
..
# NARCOTIC ABUSE  - question of ingesting large amount of
oxycodone before admission , which the patient currently
denies.Avoided narcotics. Held neurontin for  given mental
status changes.
 .
#Diarrhea: may be due to opiate withdrawal.  C.diff was
negative.

Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital3 15174**] for treatment of
altered mental status.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 52 year old woman with past medical history
significant for chronic pain on narcotics and benzodiazepines,
malabsorption syndrome due to complications of gastric bypass
surgery, and severe osteoporosis.  Three days prior to her
admission to the outside hospital, the patient presented to her
PCP's office for evaluation of ~20 pound weight loss that had
occurred over the past 6-8 weeks.  The patient was found to have
a urinary tract infection, and she was prescribed Ciprofloxacin.
 The patient took two doses of the antibiotic.  The following
day, the patient's husband noted that his wife seemed very
nervous and agitated.  He called the PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] advised the
patient to discontinue the Ciprofloxacin.  That evening, the
patient's husband noted that the patient was laughing
inappropriately while she watched TV.  She thought the TV was
""talking to her.""  The patient's husband called 911, but by the
time the EMTs arrived at their home, the patient was able to
answer questions correctly, and she refused to go to the
hospital.  The following morning, the patient was noted to be
more agitated, paranoid, and delusional, so her huaband called
911 again.  This time, the patient was taken to
[**Hospital3 15174**].
   On presentation to the outside hospital, the patient was
noted to have a low grade temperature (100.2). Her neurologic
exam was reported as ""non-focal,"" and a non-contrast head CT was
negative for bleed. The patient's tox screen was negative for
ETOH.  Her other laboratory data was unremarkable.  The patient
was admitted to the hospital for treatment of narcotic
withdrawal.
   During her 36 hour hospitalization, the patient was given two
doses of Buprenex.  Subsequently, the patient became lethargic,
confused, combative, and agitated.  She was transferred to the
ICU for further management.  She was given a few doses of Haldol
and Ativan for her agitation.  Lumbar puncture was unsuccessful.
 Given her persistent agitation and concern for narcotic
withdrawal, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for
further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. MICU COURSE ([**Date range (1) 12258**]): Pt had an LP and the results of
the CSF analysis were unremarkable. Her mental status improved
in ICU and she became much more alert and was oriented by the
morning of the second hospital day. While in the ICU, the
chronic pain service was consulted. Their recommendations are
noted below.

2. Altered mental status: As above, the pt. underwent a lumbar
puncture, the results of which were not suggestive of CNS
infection as the cause of her encephalopathy.  A TSH, B12 and
electrolytes were sent which were all within normal limits. An
RPR was sent and was nonreactive. Upon further discussion with
the pt. when she became more alert, it was discovered that after
taking the first two doses of ciprofloxacin the week prior to
admission, the pt. became extremely nauseous and had episodes of
emesis and diarrhea.  This led the pt. to stop taking her
narcotics which she is on chronically for pain.  Thus, it was
believed that the pt's. altered mental status was secondary to
narcotics withdrawal.  It should be noted, however, that
ciprofloxacin has been associated with acute psychosis,
seizures, and acute delirium.

3. Chronic pain: The pt. reported that she had been on large
doses of oxycontin, valium and neurontin for pain in her right
shoulder, back and legs prior to admission.  In the context of
her heavy narcotics use, a chronic pain service consult was
obtained while the pt. was in the intensive care unit.  They
recommended stopping oxycontin and decreasing the dose of
valium.  In addition, they recommended continuing neurontin and
adding methadone.  The pt. initially tolerated this regimen
well.  However, on the fourth hospital day, the pt. continued to
complain of leg spasms.  Baclofen was introduced with some
success in relieving her spasms.
The pain service also recommended that the pt. be started on
celecoxib for musculoskeletal pain but this was held over the
concern of possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the
setting of iron deficiency anemia of yet uncertain etiology.

4. Iron deficiency anemia:  The pt. was found to have profound
iron deficiency anemia on admission.  Further discussion with
the pt. and her PCP revealed that the pt. has known iron
deficiency and has received supplementation in the past.  A
gastroenterology consult was called.  They had recommended
performing both colonoscopy to examine for occult malignancy
(especially in the face of recent unintentional weight loss and
cachexia) and an EGD to evaluate the anatomy of her upper GI
tract in light of her prior gastric bypass.  The pt. did not
desire to undergo these procedures during this inpatient
hospitalization, but agreed to follow-up for these studies on an
outpatient basis.  The importance of following-up regarding this
issue was explicitly stressed to the pt. prior to discharge.
She was discharged on 325mg of ferrous sulfate once per day.

5. Weight loss/cachexia/?malabsorption:  In light of the pt's.
~20 pounds over the 6 to 8 weeks prior to admission, a nutrition
consult was obtained.  They had recommended TPN in addition to
encouraging the pt. to increase her p.o. intake.  The pt. did
received three days of TPN through a PICC line in addition to a
regular diet.  There was, again, concern over occult malignancy
which further prompted the desire to perform a colonoscopy.  A
breast exam was also performed as a part of a malignancy work-up
and was unremarkable.  The pt. stated that she has had a
""negative"" mammography within the last year.
The gastroenterology service also raised the possibility of
celiac disease and tTG-IgA and endomysial antibodies were sent
and were pending at the time of discharge.
There is also the possibility that her weight loss is secondary
to her profound depression with vegetative symptoms.

6. Depression: The pt. admitted to severe depression in the
months prior to admission.  As such, the psychiatry service was
consulted.  They recommended re-starting fluoxetine which was
done at a dose of 20mg per day.

7. Osteoporosis: The pt. was started on calcium and vitamin D
supplementation.

8. Migraine Headaches: The pt. complained of headache suggestive
of typical (not classical) migraine.  Her pain was not relieved
with acetaminophen.  A trial of subcutaneous sumatriptan,
however, did provide relief.  She was discharged with a
prescription for subcutaneous sumatriptan with instructions to
stop taking the medication if she experienced flushing,
dizziness, fatigue (suggestive of serotonin syndrome due to
concomitant use of fluoxetine).

Brief Hospital Course:
24 yo woman with hx of SLE, ERSD on HD, admitted with
hypertensive urgency.
.
# Hypertensive Urgency:  Pt with extensive history of
hypertension. Patient's BP improved with nicardipine drip.
Became increased yesterday when the patient missed a dose of
oral nicardipine, but came down after a replacement dose.
Restarted all home oral antihypertensives including nicardipine
30 Q8H, aliskerin 150mg [**Hospital1 **], labetalol 900mg TID, hydralazine
100mg TID, and clonidine 0.3mg + 0.1mg weekly at current doses.
Blood pressure remains labile and renal continues to follow
patient.
  Pt was transferred to the floor as blood pressure stabilized.
BP has remained stable with systolics 140s-170s. In the MICU,
Nifedipine extended release was added in place of Nicardipine as
pt's blood pressures seemed to rise prior to Nicardipine doses.
.
#  Hyperkalemia:  Ocurred on the day after admission.  Resolved
with administration of kayexalate. Pt continued hemodialysis on
TuThSat.
.
# Left abdominal wall hematoma:  Abd CT showed a mild decrease
in the size.  Pt reported that morphine did not help pain, and
was switched to dilaudid PO in the MICU. However, given pt's
recent prior admission required narcan following sensitivity to
narcotics, dilaudid was d/c'ed on the floor. Pt was continued on
gabapentin, tylenol around the clock, and low-dose Morphine as
needed for pain. Narcotics should be avoided in the future. Pain
should also resolve in the next few weeks as hematoma resolves.
.
# SLE: Pt was continued on prednisone at 4 mg PO daily.
.
#ESRD: Renal was following during her stay. She continued HD on
her T, Th, Sat schedule.

# Anemia: Hct was mildly decreased from baseline during
admission. This is likely secondary to AOCD and in the setting
of renal failure.
.
# SVC thrombus:  Patient is on anticoagulation, likely lifelong.
Patient was supratherapeutic on coumadin on admission and
coumadin was subsequently held. Then INR became subtherapeutic,
so heparin gtt was used to bridge. On day of discharge, INR
became therapeutic, and pt was discharged home on Coumadin 4mg
PO daily, with INR to be checked next at hemodialysis
.
# HOCM: Pt has evidence of myocardial hypertrophy on recent
Echo. She was not symptomatic during her stay. She was continued
on her beta blocker.
.
# Depression/anxiety. She was continued on celexa and clonazepam
PRN.
.
# OSA: CPAP for sleep with 7 pressure.

medications with improvement of your blood pressure. One new
medication was added as your hypertension was difficult to
control.

You were also started on a heparin drip while restarting your
coumadin since you have a known clot in your veins. You will
need to continue your Coumadin at 4mg daily and have your INR
checked AT DIALYSIS next week.

Please take all medications as prescribed. It is important that
you do not miss doses of your medications since your blood
pressure is very sensitive to missed doses. Please keep ALL
scheduled appointments.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the MICU on a NTG gtt from the ED.
Her abdominal pain had imporved and she was eating crackers and
peanut butter. She was given her usual afternoon home
medications, and transitioned to a Nicardipine gtt, which has
worked well for her in the past.  Her BP goal was for a systolic
of 180-200. The Nicardipine gtt was titrated off quickly and she
was transfered to the floor.
.
On arrival to the floor, she in fact missed her morning
medications on [**Month/Day/Year 766**]. This resulted in elevate blood pressures
requiring IV hydralazing for control. She went to dialyisis
Tuesday [**3-27**] and again had markedly elevated blood pressures
while at [**Month/Year (2) 2286**] from missing her AM doses. Instructions were
written for explicit AM administration and Nifedipine long
acting 30mg was added at night, in addition to the 90mg long
acting she was taking in the morning.  She was continued on
labetalol 900mg TID, Aliskerin, Hydralazine 100mg po TID, and
clonidine patch 0.4mg/24 weekly patch.
.
HEr BP remained relativly stable. She established a three three
times weekly Dialysus regemin. A PAP smear was attempted due to
her history of CIN I and no PCP follow up, but was unsucesfull
due to a very small vaginal introutus and no small specuilum
available.
.
Her abdominal pain was also a chronic issue, which appeared
stable. She was not administered IV narcotics, only PO. It was
wihtout clear percipitating events or etiology. She will need GI
follow up.  She was contact[**Name (NI) **] by phone several times to arrange
a GI follow up appointment but did not return messages. She has
a history of multiple missed appointments and no appoitment was
made without confirming with the patient that she would attend.
.
She was discharged to followup with her nephrologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 4883**].

Ms. [**Known lastname 805**] is a 46 year old woman with h/o hemorrhagic stroke
with residual spasticity and weakness, seizure disorder,
depression, Hepatitis C, who was brought it by EMS after being
found unresponsive at home, after a suicide attempt
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# Acute overdose: Likely due to ingestion of Morphine, +/-
Flexeril. Serum tox was negative. No evidence of active
infection. Her mental status quickly improved on Narcan gtt,
which was d/c'd after the pt woke up. We initially held sedating
medications: morphine, seroquel, flexeril, hydroxyzine; but
later restarted seroquel when pt was highly agitated.  She also
received tramadol as substitute for morphine for her chronic leg
pain, but then refused this medication. Currently she is on
morphine 5mg PO q6h.

# Depression/Suicide attempt: Patient ingested morphine and
other pills in a suicidal attempt after an argument with her
mother. She continued to be tearful and extremely upset that she
was still alive, and was refusing medications, radiology, and
blood draws.  She was maintained on a 1:1 sitter and suicide
precautions. Psych evaluated her on [**6-23**], and recommended haldol
IV prn as well as inpatient psychiatric hospitalization.  She
became agitated and yelled out at RN staffing on [**6-28**] and then
received a dose of oral and then a dose of IV haldol.  She will
receive further psychiatric care in the inpatient psych setting.


#Chronic Spasticity/Pain: Managed with baclofen pump as an
outpatient and she is followed by Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 24792**], at his
office address on [**Street Address(2) 94477**], [**Location (un) 38**], [**Numeric Identifier 34404**].  His phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 94478**].
The chronic pain service here spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24792**] and agreed
to refill her baclofen pump while she is an inpatient at [**Hospital1 18**]
to avoid having her travel to brain tree as she remains on
suidice precautions.  However, intrathecal baclofen not
available until [**7-2**] at the earliest.   The chronic pain service
is available to refill her pump at [**Hospital1 18**] if she is hospitalized
at DEAC4.  They will perform the refill at her bedside when the
baclofen intrathecal dose is available from the pharmacy in the
next few days.  They can be paged by typing OUCH into the paging
directory (Contact has been Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 94479**] [**Name (STitle) **]).  Baclofen 5mg PO
TID started to help diminish spasticity, as plan will be to
increase intraethcal dose when it is refilled.

however, If she does not have baclofen pump refill prior to [**7-10**], then the receiving staff should arrange for her baclofen pump
to be refilled on [**7-10**] or [**7-11**] at Dr.[**Name (NI) 94480**] office.

# Seizure disorder:  Neurology followed the patient.  At her
last discharge she was sent to rehab on 3 AEDs including
dilantin, keppra, and lacosamide.  At discharge she was only
continued only on dilantin for unclear reasons.  Given lack of
clinical seizure activity during this admission and no seizure
activity on an EEG here, neurology recommended continuing her
only on the dilantin alone and arranging for outpatient
neurology f/u with her epilepsy specialist upon discharge from
her psych admission.

# Abdominal distension/vomiting: Patient initially p/w firm,
tender abdomen on exam, but no rebound or guarding. Per patient,
this is not new, and she had a BM after admission. She had a KUB
with large gastric bubble, ?pill bezoar, urinary retention may
have contributed to her abd discomfort.  This improved and she
had no active complaints of this symptom.

# Urinary retention: Has baseline retention from her h/o CVAs
and is being treated with Flomax as an outpatient. Large dose of
narcotics she took may be contributing as well.  Patient refused
Foley placement or straight cath after admission. We continued
Flomax. She underwent straight cath on [**6-25**] with 1400 cc of NS.
She began voiding spontaneously on [**6-26**].
.
#Possible Aspiration: CXR with increased LLL opacity, which
could have represented pneumonia vs pneumonitis due to possible
aspiration event while the patient was unresponsive. Given that
the patient had no fever, elevated WBC count, cough, we held on
treating possible PNA.

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# Seizure disorder: continued dilantin, level 10.3 (trough on
[**6-28**])

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypertensive Urgency - At the time of admission, the patient
denied chest pain but continued to have mild headache.  She also
had resolving shortness of breath, likely secondary to
hypertension.  She stated that she did take her PO meds.  She
was started on a labetalol drip and continued on her home
regimen of oral labetolol, nifedipine, hydralazine, and
aliskerin.  A sent of cardiac enzymes was sent and revealed a
CPK of 59 and a troponin of 0.18.  The patient also underwent
dialysis in the ICU.  After dialysis the labetalol drip was
weaned off.  Overnight, SBP's ranged 109 to 182 mmHg.  The
following day, her SBP's ranged 133 to 200.  Ultimately, she was
discharged home on her normal medication regimen.

# Abdominal Pain - The patient also presented complaining of
adbominal pain.  She had recently been treated for SBO; however,
at the time of admit, she was without nausea or vomiting.  She
had a soft abdomen, was passing flatus, and was having daily
bowel movements.  She did have hypoactive bowel sounds.  She was
continued of her outpatient pain regimen of PO dilaudid,
fentanyl patch, and lidoacine patch.  An ultrasound of her abd
was also performed and showed ascites in all 4 quadrants with
the largest in the left lower quadrant measuring 5.5cm.
Considering her history of thrombosis, renal recommended getting
an abdominal ultrasound with doppler flow studies.  This
ultrasound showed mild to moderate ascites, a 9mm hemangioma,
and no evidence of thrombosis.  After the results of this
ultrasound were reviewed, the patient was discharged home with a
plan to follow-up with liver regarding her ascites and whether
it can be attributed to her recent SBO.

# ESRD on HD - The patient gets hemodialysis on a Tu/Th/Sa
schedule.  On admit, the patient was continued on her home does
of sevalemer.  Renal was consulted, and the patient received
dialysis on [**7-7**] in the ICU.

# Anemia/Pancytopenia - The patient has a chronic anemia and
baseline pancytopenia that are likely secondary to her CKD and
SLE.  On admit she was actually above baseline.  She was
continued on her home does of epogen.

# H/o Gastric Ulcer - The patient was continued on her PPI [**Hospital1 **].


# SLE - The patient was continued on her home regimen of
prednisone 4mg po daily.

# H/o SVC Thrombosis - The patient has a goal INR of [**2-13**].
However, naticoagulation was stopped after a recent admission
secondary to a supratherapeutic INR.  On admit, her INR was
sub-therapeutic.  Therefore, her warfarin was restarted at 3 mg
daily.

# Seizure Disorder - The patient was continued on her home
regimen of keppra 1000 mg PO 3 times a week (Tu/Th/Sa).

# Depression - The patient was continued on her home dose of
celexa.

Hypertensive Emergency: Patient's blood pressure normalized with
transient nitroglycerin and labetalol drips. Likely precipitated
by lack of ultrafiltration at [**Year/Month/Day 2286**] yesterday. She has
received [**Year/Month/Day 2286**] and her blood pressures remained at her

.
Social Issues/repeated admissions:  The ICU and medicine floor
addendings felt it important to express concern over her
repeated, frequent admissions for hypertensive urgency.  These
episodes may be due to medication non-compliance and it may
benefit Ms. [**Known lastname **] to be evaluated by an extended care facility
to ensure proper blood pressure monitoring and health care in
general.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 323**] refused to go to a ""home"" and
declined to talk to social work at this time.  Of note, she has
missed [**Last Name (Titles) 2286**] sessions and often requests durations and flow
rates for her [**Last Name (Titles) 2286**] that contradict recommendations by her
nephrologist.  This issue was left unresolved on discharge.
.
Chronic Abdominal Pain: Currently managed with PO dilaudid,
fentanyl patch and lidocaine patch. Per MICU team, prior
authorization paperwork for fentanyl was sent during last
admission and is pending.

.
Lupus Erythematous: Complicated by uveitis and ESRD.
- continued prednisone
.
ESRD: On [**Last Name (Titles) 2286**]. Ultrafiltrate of 2 L on initial HD - continue
outpatient regimen
.
Thrombocytopenia: Remained at baseline 80s to 130s.
.
Thrombotic Events: History of SVC thrombosis with negative
workup. INR drifted up and was 3.5 on discharge.  She was asked
to hold her warfarin dose this PM and recheck her INR with VNA
services on [**2142-4-23**] to be faxed to coumadin clinic in [**Company 191**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: The patient is a 33 year old male with h/o PSA who
presented after cocaine/heroine intoxication s/p intubation post
sedation now extubated and AOX3.

1. Polysubstance abuse:
- The patient clearly overdosed on heroine and cocaine. On
further questioning, the patient was unable to provide more
details regarding the event.
- Addiction consult was placed but patient did not want to
participate in referral.
- The patient exhibited no further symptoms of withdrawal
throughout his stay.

2. Respiratory status:
- As mentioned, the patinet required intubation secondary to
sedation and inability to clear his secretions.
- The patient was given lasix in the ED for what they thought
was flash pulmonary edema. His CXR showed ?RL infiltrate but was
felt not to be significant given his clinical picture.
- He self-extubated himself and continued to sat well off of O2.

3. ID- ?RL infiltrate
- Patient did not spike fevers with no WBC with questionable RL
infiltrate on CXR. There was no evidence to support a pneumonia
and thus the patient was not treated with antibiotics.

4. Hepatitis C:
- The patient has received no prior treatment and his LFTs were
within normal limits.

5. Mental status change:
- The patient arrived to the FICY very sedated. This was most
likely due to the 20 mg IV haldol and 4 mg Ativan the patient
received in the ED. The patient was not fully cooperative on
physical exam but alert and oriented times three.

The patient was discharged from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with no further events
once he remained stable and was able to tolerate PO intake and
asked to follow up with his primary care physician.

lymphocytes.
2)BILAT UP EXT VEINS US ([**11-26**]): No evidence of deep vein
thrombosis of the right or left upper extremity.
3) MRI/MRA ([**11-30**]): FINDINGS: Examination is somewhat limited by
patient motion. T2/FLAIR sequences are unremarkable with
interval resolve of previously noted posterior abnormalities.
The major vessels appear patent proximally. There are stable
areas of low signal in the left frontal and right
occipetal/temporal lobes.
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval resolution of previously noted posterior white
matter
abnormalities.
2. Stable prior areas of hemorrhage within the left frontal and
right
occipital/temporal regions.
3. Very limited MRA as above.


Brief Hospital Course:
24yo F with SLE, ESRD on HD and malignant hypertension who
presented with abdominal pain and headache and was admitted for
hypertensive urgency.

[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course:
The patient was admitted for blood pressure management and
evaluation of abd pain. An A-line was placed. EKG showed no
change from prior, and Abd x-ray showed a suggestion of RLL/R
diaphragm haziness. IV labetalol was started, and SBPS dropped
from 200s to 130s-160s. The patient had no symptoms of end-organ
damage. The renal team was consulted, and recommended no change
to home med regimen. The patient was found to be hypocalcemic,
and was started on calcium replacement therapy. When stable,
patient succesfully switched to PO meds and transferred to the
floor.

Upon transfer to the floor, the following was her course:

1. Hypertensive Urgency: Pt had had hemodialysis one day prior
to admission, so unlikely that she was volume overloaded.
Unclear what precipitated this episode of hypertensive urgency,
although suspect secondary to abdominal pain leading to an
anxiety which then precipitates hypertension. She may not have
been taking her medications secondary to pain.  Negative serum
tox.  On the floor, we continued hemodialysis Tu, Th, Sat. She
was initially continued on PO Labetolol 400mg TID, Hydralazine
100mg PO q8H, Nifedipine 90mg PO qday and clonidine; she
received hydralazine 10mg IV for goal BP < 180/100. Renal team
followed patient during this hospitalization. Per renal team
recs, labetalol was increased to 800mg TID due to poor blood
pressure control. Pt discharged on clonidine 0.3mg patch,
Hydralazine 100mg three times a day, Aliskiren 150mg twice a
day, Nifedipine 90mg daily and lobatalol 800mg TID.  This
regimen worked well.

2. Abdominal Pain: Extensive prior workup unrevealing. Pt had
recent CT scan during prior admission which did not show source
of abdominal pain. On admission, LFTs were normal except for
slightly low albumin, lipase was slightly elevated and KUB was
negative for free air or evidence of SBO. Peritoneal fluid was
negative for malignant cells but showed reactive mesothelial
cells, macrophages, eosinophils and lymphocytes. Negative gram
stain or peritoneal fluid cultures, excluding SBP as a cause of
the abdominal pain. PD catheter was not removed. Pt was
continued on PO dilaudid 1-2mg Q6h and pain resolved. She denied
N/V/diarrhea or constipation.

3. ESRD: Pt on hemodialysis, on T/Th/Sat schedule. Renal
following patient closely throughout this hospitalization. Lytes
were checked frequently and kayexalate given prn.

4. Hx of SVC/brachiocephalic DVT: Pt was initially
subtherapeutic on coumadin. Unclear if she had not been taking
Coumadin although patient reported that she has been taking all
home meds. We started heparin gtt to bridge to Coumadin. Once
therapeutic, continued Coumadin 5mg PO qday.

5. Anxiety: Likely contributing to medical problems and could
have very well been the etiology of this admission. Although pt
stated she was taking her current medications, she did report
increased anxiety which can lead to medication non-compliance
and hypertension. Pt recently saw psychiatrist who started her
on Celexa. She was continued on celexa 20mg PO qday, ativan 1mg
PO q8hours PRN and psychiatry was re-consulted. Per psych recs,
started standing clonazepam. Pt refused psych VNA.  Outpatient
PCP followup recommended.

6. Headache NOS: Pt complained of R-sided HA for several weeks,
radiating to R jaw where patient had previous tooth extraction.
Right upper extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT.    She
did not have any focal neuro findings, no visual deficits. She
was initially treated with tylenol PRN Q6h; pt requested IV
dilaudid for HA, but use of this medication by IV route was
limited by team. It was felt by the pain service that her HA did
not fit migraine, tension type HA or rebound HA. They
recommended increasing dilaudid to 4-6mg Q6h PRN, continuing
tylenol and starting neurontin 300mg Qhs which was slowly
titrated to 300mg [**Hospital1 **] for better control. Per pain recs, a
neurology consult was also obtained during this admission.
MRI/MRA showed interval resolution of previously noted posterior
white matter abnormalities and stable prior areas of hemorrhage
within the left frontal and right occipital/temporal regions,
but very limited MRA as above. Per pain recs, dilaudid was
further increased to 4mg q4h for better control of her HA.
Neurology recommended outpt f/u and Pt scheduled with [**Hospital 878**]
clinic with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] on [**2141-12-12**].

7. Anemia: Likely related to ESRD. No evidence of acute
bleeding. Hct remained stable during this hospitalization.

8. SLE: no acute issues. continued Prednisone 4mg PO qday

9. FEN: tolerated regular diet, repleted lytes PRN

9. Prophylaxis: Heparin gtt, then coumadin, bowel regigmen

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with abdominal pain, high blood pressure, and
headache.  Your abdominal pain resolved - no serious cause of
this pain was found.  Your blood pressure medications were
continued, and with an increased in one medication, the
labetalol.  Your blood pressure improved.  You should continue
the clonidine 0.3mg patch changed on [**Year (4 digits) 766**], Hydralazine 100mg
three times a day, Aliskiren 150mg twice a day, and Nifedipine
90mg daily.  The dose of Labetalol was increased to 800 mg three
times daily by you kidney doctor and you are given a new
prescription.  Please take all medications as listed below.

For your headache, you had an MRI and MRA of the head, which did
not show a new or serious abnormality.  You were seen by the
neurology and pain services.  You should follow up at [**Hospital 878**]
clinic with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] on [**2141-12-12**] at 6:30 PM (in
the evening).  Your pain was managed by oral dilaudid, 4mg.  You
should take this medication every 4 hours as needed.  You were
also started on Gabapentin (also called Neurontin) for the
headache.  The dose was slowly increased to twice a day.  You
may not need as much dilaudid for your headache and should wean
this medication as tolerated, given it's potential for side
effects (constipation, lethargy, dependence).  Finally, you will
likely need medications for constipation while you take
dilaudid.  Take colace (a stool softener), senna (a laxative),
and bisacodyl (another laxative), as needed.

It is really important that you have a primary care doctor.  You
are scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (see below) next Tuesday.  You
will need your INR checked since you are on coumadin.

Call your doctor if you have worsened headache, chest pain,
confusion, or any other concerning symptom.

was called and intubated him on the field.  Per report, he
remained unresponsive despite narcan and paralytics.  CXR at
[**Hospital3 **] suggested aspiration and he was reportedly
given gent/vanc/CTX/Flagyl.  He was hypotensive in the 80s, and
norepi and phenylephrine were started.  He was found to be
hyperkalemia to the [**6-6**] with EKG change but only received
insulin and dextrose.  Patient was [**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital1 18**] and had
fever up to 101.

PERTINENT STUDIES
[**10-20**] CT HEAD
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or
recent infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size
and
appearance. No concerning osseous lesion or fracture is seen.
There are
multiple air-fluid levels throughout the visualized paranasal
sinus, commonly seen with intubation. The mastoid air cells are
clear.
IMPRESSION: No CT evidence of acute intracranial process.
.
[**10-20**] CT Spine
FINDINGS: No acute fracture or malalignment is seen. The
atlantoaxial and
atlanto-occipital articulations are preserved. The prevertebral
soft tissues are within normal limits. The patient is intubated
and a nasogastric tube is noted in the esophagus. Air-fluid
level in the right maxillary sinus is compatible with
intubation. The mastoid air cells are clear. Within the
visualized portions of the lung apices, opacities of the right
lung are partially imaged, better seen on radiograph of the same
date.
IMPRESSION: No acute fracture or malalignment.
.
[**10-20**] CXR portable
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse opacification of the right lung, and to a lesser
extent within the left perihilar region. Findings may represent
multifocal pneumonia,
aspiration, or possibly hemorrhage.
2. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes in standard
positions.
.
[**10-23**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. No vegetation/mass
is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
A PICC line is seen in the RA prolapsing through the tricupsid
valve without any vegetations seen on the line.
IMPRESSION: No valve vegetations seen.
.
[**10-25**] CXR portable
FINDINGS: Frontal view of the chest. Endotracheal tube has been
removed.
Right subclavian catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
The heart is of normal size with an unchanged cardiomediastinal
silhouette. Bilateral
diffuse heterogeneous hazy opacities, right greater than left,
have slightly improved since [**2102-10-24**]. No new focal
opacity, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Interval extubation with slight improvement in
diffuse hazy
opacities, right worse than left.


Brief Hospital Course:
28 yo M with polysubstance abuse, reported schizophrenia &
bipolar, found unresponsive requiring intubation, transferred
from OSH for workup and treatment and was found to have
aspiration pneumonia in the setting of polysubstance overdose.
.
# Shock.  Pt initially present with hypotension requiring 6 L
IVF in the ED with upto 2 pressors in the MICU.  The cause of
shock is likely septic in nature, likely secondary to aspiration
pneumonia.  He was covered with antibiotics since admission,
gent/vanco/ceftriaxone/flagyl at OSH, unasyn initially in ED of
[**Hospital1 **], vanco/zosyn in the MICU, clindamycin after arriving the
floor and finished with augmentin for an accumulative total of
10 days.  His culture was only notable for MSSA on sputum
culture from the day after admission.  His urine, blood culture,
and BAL were otherwise negative.  Upon discharge, pt was
hemodynamically stable.
.
# Aspiration pneumonia / respiratory distress: Pt's chest x-ray
on admission was concerning for multilobar pneumonia on the
right side.  The history of unresponsiveness and fairly rapid
radiographical resolution are most consistent with aspiration
pneumonia.  Pt was initially broadly covered with antibiotics,
which was later tailed based on the clinical course and MSSA
grew from the sputum culture (See above).  His MICU course was
notable for hypercarbic hypoxic respiratory failure, requiring
high peep (upto 18) and heavy sedation including the use of
precedex.  This likely developed in the setting hypoventilation
secondary to sedative substance overdose.  Pt's respiratory
status improvement significantly after extubation.  Pt
maintained normal saturations without oxygenation difficulties
on the hospital floor prior to discharge to [**Hospital1 **] 4.
.
# AMS: Most likely developed because of substance overdose and
pneumonia.  He was intubated on the field and improved
gradually.  CT head/neck negative.  He self extubated on
[**2102-10-24**].  C- collar was cleared.  Mental status slightly
lethargic but improving upon transfer to the floor.  He was
alert and oriented throughout his stay on the medicine floor.
He was treated with haloperidol initially and later switched to
zyprexa for anxiety and agitation.
.
# Overdose/Polysubstance abuse: Pt came in with polysubstance
abuse, with tox screen evidence of opiate, benzo, cocaine,
tylenol.  There is also high likelihood of alcohol abuse given
the scene when pt was found.  It was suspected that the overdose
was a suicidal attempt.  Pt was evaluate by social worker and
psychiatrist during this admission.  He was placed on section 12
and one-on-one watch for the concern of suicidal ideation.  He
received valium for alcohol withdrawal per CIWA protocol, which
has been discontinued prior to discharge.  Pt was also started
on thiamine, folate and multivitamin.
.
# Transaminitis: Pt was found to have transaminitis, which
likely occurred in the setting of hypotensive shock or multidrug
toxicity.  His ALT/AST were down trend since admission.  The LFT
on discharge still showed elevation of ALT/AST, which could
reflect the ongoing hepatitis C infection.
.
# Hepatitis C: Pt was found to have positive hepatitis C
antibody, suggesting infection.  The potential source of
infection includes tattoo and IV drug use.  Of note, pt was
hepatitis B negative.  Pt will need hepatology followup for
further evaluation and potentially treatment.  Will recommend
testing for HIV in the outpatient setting once the insurance
situation resolves.
.
# NSTEMI: Pt had mildly elevated CKMB and troponin.  This likely
happened in the setting of hypotension and cocaine toxicity.
EKG showed ST depression in inferior leads.  His troponin was
down trending, and CKMB returned to [**Location 213**].
.
# Acute kidney injudry: Most likely prerenal vs ATN (in the
setting of hypotension and rhabdomyolisis).  His creatinine
normalized after supportive care.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES
# Psychiatric issues: [**Name (NI) 1094**] wife reported history of bipolar and
schizophrenia, with no prior hospitalization and medication.  No
clear evidence of active disease was observed.  Psychiatric
followup after the resolution of acute medical problems was
recommended.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 year old
female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation and depression,
who presents with decreased mental status and fevers to 102.
The patient apparently was in her usual state of health until
the day prior to admission.  She was found on the morning of
admission by her husband to be unresponsive in bed, with
empty pill bottles near her head.

The patient was brought to the Emergency Room by ambulance
and noted to be febrile to 102 on arrival.  Prescription
medications at home included Paxil, lithium, Prednisone,
Nardil and verapamil.  In the Emergency Room, the patient was
hemodynamically stable, however, was noted to be rigid on
examination.  Concern was for serotonin syndrome.  The
patient was then treated with charcoal and sorbitol,
paralyzed and intubated.

Toxicology consultation was obtained with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The patient was then admitted to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for further management.  Of note, the husband states
that the patient has been depressed, and the drug overdose
likely represents a suicide attempt.

On transfer, white blood cell count was 7.9, hematocrit 30.6,
platelet count 335,000, glucose 90, BUN 17, creatinine 0.5,
sodium 145, potassium 3.9, chloride 106, bicarbonate 32, ALT

0.2, calcium 8.4, phosphorous 3.8 and magnesium 1.8.  Head CT
scan on admission showed evidence of white matter disease, no
evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.  Chest x-ray the day
prior to transfer showed no evidence of consolidation of
effusion, no evidence of pneumothorax; there was evidence of
osteopenia with no evidence of vertebral compression
fractures in the thoracic spine.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 74 year old female with a
history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation and depression, who
presents with decreased mental status and fever to 102,
having overdosed on her prescription medications.

1.  Overdose:  The patient was found unresponsive at home and
brought to the Emergency Room, where she was responsive only
to painful stimuli.  She was then paralyzed, sedated and
intubated for airway protection.  Given the multiple empty
bottles of medications near her at the time she was found,
this is likely a complicated overdose.  A toxicology screen
was positive for opiates with an elevated acetaminophen
level.  She was given 1 mg of Narcan.  She was given charcoal
with sorbitol, followed by Mucomyst, which was continued
every four hours over the first 72 hours during her hospital
course.

Toxicology consultation was obtained was obtained with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  The patient was given a single dose of
N-acetylcysteine.  She was admitted to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit for further management.  This is a complicated drug
overdose with likely serotonin syndrome, precipitated by
Paxil and MAO inhibitors and complicated by other
medications, given the patient's presentation.  Her liver
function tests, APAP and lithium levels were initially
elevated, but were followed and trended downward.  The
patient was extubated without difficulty on [**2159-9-27**].

2.  Psychiatry:  Given the patient's history of depression
and suicide attempt, a psychiatric consultation was
requested.  The patient had a one-to-one observer out of the
Intensive Care Unit and all psychotropic medications were
held.  Her delirium continued to progressively resolve post
extubation.  She continued to have a blunted affect and
depressed mood, feeling bad about attempting to end her life.
She denied any further suicidal ideation, but was still
clearly depressed.  It was felt that the patient would
require inpatient psychiatric hospitalization after her
medical issues were resolved.

3.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient's transaminases were
elevated secondary to acetaminophen toxicity and were
followed, with downward trend.  She was noted to have guaiac
positive stools and gastroenterology was consulted regarding
this issue in the setting of a complicated overdose.  They
did not feel that she had any signs of any significant
gastrointestinal bleed and recommended a colonoscopy as an
outpatient.

4.  Pulmonary:  The patient was paralyzed and intubated on
arrival for airway protection.  She was extubated without
difficulty on [**2159-9-27**].  Post extubation, she had
oxygen saturations in the low 90s.  A chest x-ray was noted
to be without evidence of consolidation or infiltrates.  The
patient was encouraged to use her incentive spirometer, with
improvement in her oxygen saturations.

5.  Cardiovascular:  The patient has a history of atrial
fibrillation.  Her digoxin level was noted to be elevated on
arrival and digoxin was held during the course of her
hospitalization.  Her digoxin level was subsequently
decreased.  She will need to be restarted on her digoxin
sometime in the future.  Her CKs were elevated on admission,
thought to be secondary to her paralysis and drug overdose.
Her CK/MB was not elevated and her electrocardiogram showed
no ischemic changes.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be transferred to an inpatient
psychiatric unit for further treatment.

History of Present Illness:
19 year old male with PMH of major depression requiring ECT,
treated with soma, narcotics, [**First Name3 (LF) 85471**] and celebrex, who per his
girlfriend took [**Name2 (NI) 85471**], carisoprodol (soma), and narcotics in
unknown quantities to ""have a good time"" at 18:30 today. By
report, he ingested 8 soma, [**3-4**] celebrex vs [**Month/Day (3) 85471**], and an
unknown amount narcotics, and by 19:00 he was unresponsive. She
called EMS, who administered 0.5 of narcan x 2, with good
response. Then there was concern for seizure activity en route
so he received ativan 2mg x 1.

very sleepy. Deemed able to protect airway. Pupils 8mm,
reactive. Intermittent myoclonic jerks noted, with rotary
nystagmus, but no seizure activity, however he did receive
ativan 1mg x 2. This had no effect on his jerks. EKG showed
sinus tachycardia, no other abnormalities. Toxicology was
consulted: mostly CNS depressants, myoclonic jerks are med side
effect, supportive care indicated (consider airway protection,
IVF if hypotensive). Patient was started on a narcan gtt at
0.4mg/hr. Received 2L of IVF, SBPs remained in the 90s-100s.

.
# Overdose - Toxicology was consulted in the ED. They thought
that the meds he ingested (carisoprodol, oxymorphone,
pregabalin) are mainly CNS depressants, so treatment was largely
supportive until they wore off. Of note, his serum and urine
toxicology screens were negative. His labwork and metabolic
profile, inlcuing CBC, chemitries, and FLTs, was entirely normal
on admission. He did not require airway protection, and his
vital signs were entirely stable during admission. There were no
myoclonic jerks or signs of seizure activity. He was initially
on a narcan drip for 6 hours post-admission, but this was
quickly and easily discontinued. He was monitored on telemetry,
and serial EKGs were unremarkable. For any signs of opiate of
benzodiazepine withdrawal, he was treated with prn clonidine and
lorazepam, respectively.
.
# Depression - [**Hospital1 18**] Psychiatry was consulted and we were also

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 53-year-old female
found down in hotel room by EMS with change in mental status
and lethargy.  A suicide note found at the scene referenced
multiple medical problems as well as suggested ingestion of
beta blocker, muscle relaxant, and Neurontin.  Vital signs
were stable on arrival in the ED, but the patient was
minimally responsive and subsequently intubated for airway
protection.  Patient initially given 2 mg of Narcan, 4 amps
of sodium bicarb, and 5 grams of activated charcoal.

Patient's blood pressures were noted to decrease systolics to

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature 96.8, heart rate 81, blood
pressure 92/47, and saturating 100% on 40% FIO2.  General:
Patient is intubated and sedated.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal,

negative except for large blood.

EKG:  Sinus bradycardia, left bundle branch block, prolonged
QRS.  Urine tox positive for barbiturates, opiates, and
methadone.

Serum Tylenol level is 8.3.  Positive for serum barbiturates.
CK 15,000.  ALT 77, AST 159, amylase 153, alkaline
phosphatase 216, total bilirubin 0.6.  INR 1.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, patient is a 53-year-old female
with multiple medical problems and history of depression with
intentional overdose of barbiturates, opiates, Tylenol, and
beta blocker.

MICU COURSE:  Patient was maintained on insulin, D10 and
glucagon drips to maintain her hemodynamics.  This was
achieved with good effect, and they were subsequently weaned
off.  Patient was able to be extubated on hospital day three.

Psychiatry was consulted after the patient was extubated, and
felt that patient had a high suicide risk, and plan was for
her to be admitted to the Psychiatry service once medically
stable.  Patient's renal function remained stable and her CKs
trended down gradually.  Patient remained on suicide
precautions, but was deemed not to need ICU level monitoring,
and was transferred to the floor on [**1-18**].

In the a.m. of [**1-19**], the patient experienced episode of
tongue biting, unresponsiveness, disorientation.  Was loaded
on Dilantin.  Became progressively hypoxic and tachypneic
throughout the day with respiratory rates of 30-40 with a max
respiratory rate of 116, tachycardia to 120s.  Patient
subsequently was transferred back to the MICU on [**2136-1-20**] for
further monitoring.

Patient's hypoxia was felt most likely to be caused by
pneumonia.  She was started on appropriate antibiotics.
Etiology of patient's tachypnea was unclear.  Initially, the
patient's etiology of seizure was not quite clear, but
thought possibly secondary to alcohol and benzodiazepine
withdrawal.  She received EEG, MRI, LP.  Subsequently EEG was
noted to have no seizure activity.  MRI was suboptimal due to
motion artifact and LP was unremarkable.  Despite absence of
seizure activity on EEG, patient was continued on Dilantin.
Her delirium was felt possibly secondary to withdrawal versus
toxic metabolic, but gradually improved slowly, and therefore
patient did not receive treatment for barbiturate withdrawal.

Her mental status, tachypnea, and hypoxia all improved, and
patient was subsequently transferred back to the floor
medical team on [**2136-1-22**].

While on the floor, the patient's mental status was noted to
be improved back at baseline compared to that back to the
MICU, and she exhibited no evidence of barbiturate
withdrawal.  She was continued on suicide precautions with a
one-to-one sitter, and plan was for psychiatric admission
when medical issues had resolved.

On [**2136-1-23**], the night float intern was called to see the
patient as she was unresponsive.  Patient unresponsive to
verbal command, sternal rub.  Pupils were fixed and dilated.
Patient noted to be without corneal reflexes, spontaneous
breathing, heart sounds, or palpable pulses.  Patient was
pronounced dead at 6:15 a.m. on [**2136-1-23**].

Patient's family was notified and declined autopsy.  Given
the sudden unexpected nature of patient's death, the medical
examiner was contact[**Name (NI) **] and the case was accepted.  Of note at
time of death, patient was DNR/DNI.  This was initiated after
several conversations with the patient's mother, who stated
that the patient had desired to be DNR/DNI for many years,
not just in the recent past.  These facts were confirmed via
separate conversations with both the patient's lawyer and her
primary care physician.

45 yo male drug abuser on methadone with AIDS ([**5-2**] cd4 292,
vl>100k, h/o pcp pneumonia and [**Month/Year (2) 11395**] on HAART) and HCV+ found
unconscious at his group home.  He was on the couch and
unresponsive for 3-4 minutes.  EMS administered 1mg of narcan
with good response, GCS 3-->14.  His pupils were constricted but
reactive.
On arrival to the ED, he was minimally responsive, he received
1mg of narcan and became a+0x3.  He was able to tell the team
that he used iv heroine (which he later recounted), chewed two
fentanyl patches, and ingested 2mg of klonopin.  He became
unresponsive to noxious stimuli, received 4.8mg of narcan and
was started on a narcan gtt, intubated and given 50g of charcoal
with sorbitol.  Toxicology was consulted and felt not opioid
overdose, instead likely benzo intoxication with possible
narcotic withdrawal.  He also received 5liters of NS.

.
Imaging:
EKG [**2173-12-23**]: NSR @65bpm, nl axis, normal intervals, Qtc-420
unchanged except for Qtc 400 [**7-2**].
.
CXR [**2173-12-23**]: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with
the patient in supine position and is analyzed in direct
comparison with a similar study obtained 1-1/2 hours earlier
during the same day. The patient is now intubated. The ETT is
terminating in the trachea, some 6 cm above the level of the
carina. An NG tube has been passed, reaching well the fundus of
the stomach. There is no pneumothorax or any other placement
related complication. In comparison with the next preceding
study, diffuse lateral pulmonary densities have developed and
progressed significantly since the previous study obtained 1-1/2
hours earlier. The most likely explanation is CHF or perhaps
fluid overload as the heart shadow does not identify marked
cardiomegaly.
.
CT head [**2173-12-23**] :There is significant limitation of the study
secondary to patient motion, but there is no evidence for
intracranial hemorrhage. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction is
distinct. The ventricles, sulci, and cisterns demonstrate no
effacement. There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline
structures. The osseous structures are unremarkable. The
visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. The mastoid air cells
are well pneumatized.
.
CXR [**2173-12-24**]: AP chest radiograph shows endotracheal tube and
nasogastric tube in stable position. The cardiac and mediastinal
contours appear unchanged. Again seen are increased bilateral
pulmonary densities consistent with CHF or fluid overload,
unchanged from prior study.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
46 yo male with likely fentanyl overdose and benzo withdrawal
vs. intoxication, s/p intubation for airway protection.
.
# Altered mental status: His mental status began to clear in the
ICU after administration of narcan and activated charcoal.
Intoxication with methylene or ethylene glycol were ruled out,
as was hepatic encephalopathy. Toxicology was consulted to help
in his management. Once his sedation (propofol) was weaned, he
was able to be extubated and his mental status appeared to be
back to his baseline. He was restarted on his outpatient
medications which include klonopin, zoloft, elavil, neurontin
and fentanyl. He was also given thiamine/folate/MVI for h/o EtOH
abuse. Social work was consulted to address the patient's
substance abuse issues and he noted that he has strong support
system in place, through the [**Hospital1 778**] Health Clinic and AA.
.
# Anion gap metabolic acidosis: On admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 429**] had an
AG metabolic acidosis, most likely from ARF. Ingestion of
another toxin or alcohol was ruled out, EtOH was negative,
salicylates were negative, and his lactate was normal (1.1 -
1.2). The AG acidosis resolved w/ the administration of IVF and
his AG was down to 11 on discharge.
.
# ARF: Urine lytes were checked and were c/w prerenal etiology
(FeNa 0.41%). He demonstrated a quick improvement in Cr w/ IVF
which also supported that diagnosis. Urine eos were negative, so
AIN was ruled out. IVF were discontinued once he was tolerating
adequate POs. His Cr was down to 1.3 prior to discharge.
.
# AIDS: His HAART was held until [**12-25**] when his PCP could confirm
his regimen. He is currently not on any PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] as he is
allergic to Bactrim, but he and his PCP will discuss starting
dapsone as an outpatient.
.
# FEN: Once extubated, he was given a regular diet. He was
continued on IVF until his Cr came back to baseline. His
electrolytes were checked daily and were repleted prn.
.
# PAIN: Pt has chronic pain, likely from HIV-related peripheral
neuropathy. He was restarted on his outpatient regimen of
gabapentin, amitryptyline, and fentanyl once he was transferred
to the floor. On discharge, it was advised that he follow-up
with the acupuncture clinic again to attempt to address his
chronic pain needs.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Narcotic overdose.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 13474**] is a 32-year-old
woman with a history of suicidal ideation, pseudoseizures,
endometriosis status post right oophorectomy, chronic
abdominal pain, gastroparesis, and positional orthostatic
tachycardiac syndrome.

The patient presented to the emergency department on the day
of admission when he was brought in by the EMS after an
overdose of narcotics including several pills of MSIR.  More
precisely, on counting the pills, there were three bottles
provided by EMS.  The first, MS Contin was prescribed on
[**2155-5-28**], filled for 60 pills and had one pill left
in the bottle.  The second, MSIR was prescribed on [**2155-5-2**] with a prescription for 30 pills and had one left
in the bottle.  The third, MSIR, was prescribed on [**2155-6-18**] and it was for 120 pills with 20 pills left in the
bottle.  Apparently, the patient took the pills to ""go to
sleep.""  She then called her PCP to tell her about what she
had done and the PCP immediately [**Name (NI) 653**] the EMS.  When the
EMS arrived, the patient was lucid and ambulatory.  She then
quickly became unresponsive.  She was brought to [**Hospital1 346**].  En route, they were unable to
obtain IV access and they gave her a total of 6 mg IM Narcan
with no response.  In the emergency department, the patient
was intubated for respiratory depression and received a total
of 4 mg IV Narcan.  She was eventually placed on a 0.4 mg per
hour Narcan drip.  She was given p.o. charcoal and required 8
mg Ativan, while the charcoal was being administered.  She
was subsequently extubated after waking up.  The patient was
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for close
monitoring of her respiratory status, Narcan drip and
suicidal ideation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Suicidal ideation.  The patient was seen in the [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Department [**2156-7-4**] for suicidal ideation.  She was discharged after
evaluation.
2.  Postural orthostatic and tachycardiac syndrome, followed
by the neurologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2405**].  On [**2156-6-14**] the
patient underwent tilt-table testing in the autonomic
laboratory.  This study revealed postural tachycardia
followed by a hypertensive bradycardiac syncope.
3.  History of pseudoseizures.
4.  Endometriosis status post right oophorectomy.
5.  Chronic abdominal pain.
6.  Gastroparesis.
7.  PPD positive.
8.  CT angiogram on [**2156-2-21**] negative for pulmonary
embolism.
9.  Abdominal ultrasound [**2156-2-27**], negative for
gallstones.
10. CT of the head from [**2156-2-21**] negative for
hemorrhage.

1.  Reglan 10 mg p.o.q.i.d.
2.  Zofran p.r.n.
3.  Florinef 0.1 mg p.o.q.d.
4.  Motilium (motility [**Doctor Last Name 360**] available only from [**Country 26467**]).

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to DEMEROL, PERCOCET,
VICODIN, BACTRIM, COMPAZINE, AND LIDOCAINE.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her roommate.  She
was born in [**Country 26467**], which is where her family resides.
She is a research scientist with a PhD working at the [**Hospital1 1444**].  She denies the use of
alcohol or tobacco.

FAMILY HISTORY:  History is positive for coronary artery
disease and cerebrovascular accident; negative for
neurological disease.

Examination in the emergency room revealed the following:
The patient was afebrile, heart rate 95, blood pressure
135/80, respiratory rate 11, oxygen saturation 99% on room
air.  GENERAL:  The patient was depressed and tired, in no
acute distress.  HEENT:  Examination showed no jugulovenous
distention or lymphadenopathy.  Pupils equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Pupil size was
approximately 4 mm.  Extraocular movements were intact.
LUNGS:  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  HEART:
regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2, no extra heart
sounds.  ABDOMEN:  Abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  EXTREMITIES:
Extremities showed no edema, 2+ distal pulses.  NEUROLOGICAL:
Examination revealed that the patient was alert and oriented
times three, answering questions appropriately, moving all
four extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs at the time of admission revealed the
following:  The patient had a white count of 7.1, hematocrit
13.7, hematocrit 38.3, and platelet count of 364,000.  She
had a sodium of 144, potassium 3.8, chloride 105, bicarbonate
26, BUN 8, creatinine 0.9, and glucose of 129.  Urinalysis
was negative.  Coagulations were within normal limits.  Urine
toxicology screen was positive for benzodiazepines (probably
received in the emergency room) and opiates.  Urine
toxicology screen was negative.  EKG was sinus rhythm at 93
with a normal axis and normal intervals.  There were no acute
ST or T-wave changes.  Chest x-ray was clear.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit on a Narcan drip at 0.4 mg per hour.  She
was alert and cooperative at the time and remained so
throughout her admission.  On the morning of [**2156-7-6**],
the Narcan drip was slowly titrated to off.  The patient
remained alert and oriented, answering questions
appropriately without signs of respiratory distress or
depression.  She was seen by the Psychiatry Department, who
felt that the patient required inpatient [**Year (4 digits) **]
admission for a serious and almost successful suicide
attempt.  The patient was medically cleared on [**2156-7-6**]
and transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7637**]
Facility.  During the entire course of her hospital stay at
[**Hospital1 69**], she was observed by a

History of Present Illness:
42 male found down on [**Location (un) **] St. Found to have pinpoint pupils,
stable vital signs. He was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, and given narcan
with increasing wakefullness. His BS was initially 114. He was
unable to give a history, but admitted to recent use of cocaine
and valium (roughly #20 10mg tabs), as well as confirming that
he is homeless. He complained of some knee pain and foot pain,
presumably from a fall. He started in a methadone clinic last
week, and is scheduled to receive 60mg today.

ED COURSE: He was given 0.4mg narcan, to which he woke up a bit.
He then spiked to 103.1, cultured, and was given IV ceftriaxone
and vancomycin. An LP was performed which showed 3 WBC and 43

Brief Hospital Course:
42 year old male with a history of hepatitis C and polysubstance
abuse (cocaine, benzodiazepines, heroin) presents with an
opiate/valium overdose.

1) Altered MS / Overdose: He admits to taking methadone at the
clinic as scheduled. He recently had his doctor write a script
for valium, and he took most of the bottle yesterday. He also
took cocaine, but denies heroin since starting methadone. He was
intially placed on a narcan gtt in ED. Upon tranfer to the
floor, narcan gtt was stopped and patient more alert. Repeat
urine tox was still positive for benzos, opioids, methadone, and
cocaine. Of note, per pathology, levaquin can cause false
positives for opioids. The patient was restarted on methadone
(55 mg, confirmed with methadone clinic) and, at time of
discharge, had no evidence of withdrawal. Social work followed
the patient throughout his hospital course. The patient
expressed a desire for drug rehabilitation and, at time of
discharge, he was on several waiting lists.

2) Community acquired pneumonia: The patient completed a 10 day
course of levofloxacin (sputum culture grew MSSA sensitive to
levofloxacin) and, at time of discharge was afebrile with stable
O2 saturation on room air. Additional infectious work-up
included blood, urine, CSF cultures, all of which are negative
to date.

3) Hepatitis C: The patient had mild ALT/AST elevation on
admission, which was normalizing at time of discharge. A right
upper quadrant ultrasound was without evidence of biliary
dilitation. He will follow-up with liver clinic as an
outpatient.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
.
44M with hx of AIDS, CD4 of 84, substance abuse, depression and
hx of suicide attempts who presents with benzo overdose,
intubated for airway protection, developed PNA and fever, and
jaundic during ICU stay which quickly resolved.
.
1. benzo overdose/Altered mental status:
Assessed to be [**3-11**] overdose. The urine was pos for benzo,
cocaine and amphetamines.
The pt was intubated in the ED for airway protection and
admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. He was ventilated overnight, then successfully
extubated on [**12-13**]. The pt remained somnolent, requiring loud
verbal stimuli to arouse. This was thought [**3-11**] depression as
well as resolving acute illness. The LOC continued to improve.
Given the clear explanations for mental status changes, further
work-up was deferred including LP to rule out meningitis and
head CT. ID consultants agreed with this decision. The pt was
monitored on a CIWA scale as an inpatient for 4 days, and he
demonstrated no clear symptoms of withdrawal.
.
2. PNA:
The pt was noted to be febrile to 101.5 in the ICU, his CXR
showed LLL infiltrate. Levo/flagyl was initially started and the
pt responded well with the infiltrate mostly resolved by CXR on
[**12-15**]. The coverage was narrowed to levoflox alone to continue a
10 day course. Bld Cx were negative. [**Last Name (un) **] Cx showed enterococci
Sensitive to levo, assessed to be colonization by ID. stool
negative for C.diff. Pt was afebrile x48 hours at discharge.
.
3. Elevated LFTs/cholestatic jaundice:
Likely acalculous cholecystitis. On reviewing the pt's previous
labs, he has had elevated AST and ALT in the past, likely [**3-11**]
his HAART regimen or hepatitis.  However, his bilirubin has not
been this elevated in the past. AST/ALT peak on [**12-12**] 608/224. T.
bili elevated to 6 at admission. The bilirubin and liver enzymes
continued to trend down over the hospital stay. RUQ US
demonstrated no evidence of stones or ductal dilatation but
showed sludge.

4. HIV/AIDS:
Recent testing done on [**2105-11-12**] at his PCP's visit.  CD4 84 (8%)
down from 126 and VL now detectable at 10,800 copies.
Lamivudine/Abacavir/Atazanavir is home regimen. The pt reports
good compliance but according to past notes, misses approx one
dose per week.  His HIV genotyping is pending to assess for
resistance mutations. Per ID consultants the ART was held in the
setting of acute illness and will be restarted as an outpt. OI
prophylaxis was continued with atovaquone, biaxin, famvir. The
pt sees Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3640**] for ID last seen [**2105-7-30**].
.
5. Depression:
s/p suicide attempt. pt is involuntary admit. Outpt Pschiatrist
is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7339**]. The psychiatry team was consulted and followed
along. His psych meds were held for sedation during the
admission per recs, including the effexor, wellbutrin and
trazodone. CIWA scale with diazepam was continued for possible
benzo withdrawal, although the pt demonstrated no clear symptoms
of withdrawal since the admission. 1:1 sitter was continued
because of suicidal intent.
.
6. Thrombocytopenia:
Chronic, baseline between 43-75; follow and transfuse for<10
unless active bleeding
.
7. Rhabdomolysis:
Likely [**3-11**] being down for several hours. CK was trended and
declined without any other symptoms. No renal problems
developed.
8. FEN: NPO until extubated
9. PPx: pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen

History of Present Illness:
47 y.o. man with unknown PMH presents after he was found by a
neighbor at an appartment, somnolent. He apparently was found
near a bag which contained medications- methadone, klonopin, and
seroquel. He was somnolent so EMS was called and he was brought
to ED. He was given narcan in the ambulance and became more
arousable.
.
In the ED, initial vitials were: 97.7, HR 84, BP 130/86, RR 12
95%. He was given several doses of IV narcan, which he would
respond to initially, but then became more somnolent. Therefore
he was started on a narcan drip and transferred to the ICU.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU he was somnolent, snoring, but could be
aroused with voice and gentle shaking. He answered questions
with one word sentences but then fell back asleep.

# Methadone overdose: Patient's urine and serum toxocology
screens were positive only for methadone, and were negative for
alcohol, benzodiazepines, and acetaminophen. Patient was
initially arousable to voice but would fall back asleep. He was
eventually weaned off of the narcan drip, and was no longer

History of Present Illness:
46y/o male w/ MMP, in his USOH until last nite, when he put on 4
patches of fentanyl, reports takes [**12-31**] patches usually at home.
He was brought to the ED after being found in his home
unresponsive. Patient difficult to arouse, opened his eyes to
voice orders, responded to pain. PEERLA.After 0.25mg of narcan,
woke up, states that he had 4 fentanyl patches today but we did
not see any of those on him. Denies used of any other drug. No
alcohol.Denies any headache, visual changes, chest pain,
shortness of breath, abdominal complaints, dysuria or
constipation.
..
Of note, he was recently admitted on [**5-23**] and d/c on [**6-2**] for
mental status changes which were presumed at that time to be
partially secondary to drug use and hypotension.  During that
admission he was briefly intubated, had a negative LP and
negative MRI.  Ultimately it was determined that his methadone
dose was too high, it was then titrated and he was discharged on
100 mg methdone daily.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Unresponsiveness/Mental status changes were felt to be due to
fentanyl overdose and interaction with benzodiazepines.  In the
ED the patient woke up to 0.5 mg narcan for 20 mins and needed
repeated narcan 4 x. The negative head CT, normal WBC count,
lack of fever and signs of menigismus and quick response to
narcan were in support of overdose as the cause for MS changes.
In addition, urine tests were positive for benzos, opiates, and
cocaine.  Patient was continued on narcan drip overnite and
weaned without diffuculty.  At discharge he was alert and
oriented x3.  He was not discharged on methadone and will follow
up with PCP and possibly restart methadone maintenance at [**Location (un) 27561**] after discharge.  He was discharged with a new Duragesic
patch and an Rx for one more patch.  He will follow up with his
PCP for further pain management.

-f/u gap in chem 7
..
#Acute renal failure - Patient's initial creatinine was 2.8 with
a baseline of 1.1-1.2.  This ARF was most likely due to
dehydration/poor PO intake.  Lisinopril was held, he was
rehydrated with NS and his creatinine returned to baseline.
..
#CAD/Hypotension - Antihypertensives were held at admission and
he received 2L NS in the ED which increased his SBP of 80-90 to
SBP 110s.   Restarted outpatient cardiac meds on discharge as BP
returned to 130's/70's.
..
#Anemia - Patient's baseline hct is 33-37, on admission was
noted to be 32.2.  Most likely anemia of chronic disease.  Plan
to follow up as outpatient.
..
#Etoh history-  Patient was place on CIWA scale for withdrawal
monitoring and given a given a banana bag for vitamin repletion.
 He was also started on thiamine and folate daily.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 F with PMH chronic pain from DJD, hypothyroidism, urinary
incontinence, now with resolving Ecoli sepsis from R renal
abscess and change in mental status.
.
# Ecoli sepsis / R renal abscess:
In the MICU, pt was in septic shock, with SBP 80-90s.  CT Abd
showed R hydronephrosis and hydroureter with 9mm stone.  Pt had
a percutaneous R nephrostomy tube placed by IR with frank pus
draining out.  Pt was found to have Ecoli in blood cxs, and cxs
from pus drained from kidney also was positive for Ecoli.  Pt
was started on decadron, weaned from levophed, and continued on
Vanco, Levo and Flagyl to cover from likely source of kidney
abscess.  Pt was found to be prerenal and was fluid
resuscitated. Pt was stabilized, transferred to the medical
floor, where she was continued on Levo only.  Likely reason for
pt's changed mental status and being found in ""old urine"" is R
renal pyogenic abscess, and also narcotic use.  Pt will be
following up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 770**] for lithotripsy of R 9 mm
stone.  Pt will need to be monitored as outpatient for
resolution of infection.
.
# ARF:
Resolved. Cr 2.2 on admission, baseline 0.9 by discharge.
Likely prerenal and also in setting of R renal abscess, was
fluid resuscitated in MICU.  Meds were renally dosed.
.
# Thrombocytopenia:
Resolved. Heme consult stated thrombocytopenia was most likely
in the setting of sepsis.  Pt has a history of GIB.  Will keep
Hct > 28 and Plt > 10 as long as no signs of bleeding.
.
# Mental status change:
Pt was very confused and was drowsy on and off in the MICU, but
on the floor, pt became completely clear and articulate, able to
communicate.  At her baseline, she is functional with full adls.
 Benzos and narcotics were minimized, keeping her on methadone
10 [**Hospital1 **] and oxycodone Q6H prn.  Pt has history of narcotic abuse.
 Pt's mental status on admission was likely due to a combination
of taking too much narcotics and sepsis.
.
# History of urinary incontinence:
Pt has history of urinary incontinence, likely from narcotic
use.  Foley will be maintained in place until urology f/u with
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 770**].
.
# Cardiac status:
CXR had shown questionable CHF.  Pt was ruled out for MI.  Pt
has no history of CHF or cardiac dz.  TTE showed EF 60%, 1+ MR,
1+ AR, no pulm HTN.  EKGs were unchanged.
.
# Hypothyroidism:
Levoxyl was continued per home regimen.
.
# Chronic pain from DJD / Narcotic abuse:
Pt has a history of chronic narcotic use for DJD pain control.
Narcotics were not given in MICU, for lack of patient's pain,
but pt was placed on flexeril, tylenol RTC, methadone 10 [**Hospital1 **],
oxycodone prn.  Pt initially had signs of narcotic withdrawal on
floor (diffuse abdominal pain, restlessness and discomfort) that
had resolved upon discharge.
.
# Nutrition:
Pt was placed on a pureed renal diet.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Seizure: Patient was intubated in the field for airway
protection.  He didn't have any further seizure activity but was
notably restless in bed.  He was found to have an elevated WBC
and fever in the ED.  He was treated empiracally with
Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and DMS.  An LP was performed.  It was
negative for mengingitis and xanthrochromia.  A head CT was
negative for mass lesions or evidence of bleed.  A urine tox
screen was positive for cocaine and benzodiazepines. He was
started on valium to cover for possible benzodiazepine
withdrawal.  He was transferred to th [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
management.  His mother was called and she confirmed that he had
a history of polysubstance abuse including xanax, cocaine,
methadone, and heroin and said that he had admitted to currently
actively using drugs.  She denied any significant history of
alcohol abuse.  The timing of the patient going fishing and not
having access to xanax was consistent with benzodiazepine
withdrawal.  He was extubated without difficulty early the next
day and remained on standing valium to treat benzodiazepine
withdrawal.  He did not have any further seizure activity.
He was discharged directly from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in stable condition.
.
#R Hand fracture: Patient was noted to ahve a R hand fracture.
Patient unclear when or how it happened but says that he has
been trying to ""[**Doctor Last Name **] it back into place"" himself, without
success.  He has been taking percocet for pain.  Ortho was
consulted and they recommended a cast, which the patient refused
to wear.  Advised patient to follow up with either the hand
clinic here at [**Hospital1 **] or with his PCP in [**Name9 (PRE) 1727**].
.
#C spine: Patient was placed in a C-collar in the field. No
obvious fracture noted on films.  He was clinically cleared once
he was extubated.
.
#Polysubstance abuse: Discussed negative impact of drugs on
patient's life and strongly advised him to consider stopping.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 47-year-old female
with history of polysubstance abuse and asthma as well as
question of a seizure disorder secondary to head injury
greater than 10 years ago, history of depression and anxiety
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from the outside
hospital on [**2150-5-22**] for a Klonopin/Dilaudid overdose
complicated by rhabdomyolysis and transaminitis, change in
mental status, and intubated for airway protection and
hypercarbic respiratory failure who was transferred to the
floor on [**2150-5-24**] after extubation for further management.

Patient apparently had a suicide pact with her husband two
days prior to admission on [**2150-5-20**] and overdosed on
Dilaudid 300 mg (150, 2 mg tabs) and Klonopin 200 mg (50, 4
mg tabs).

Patient was found unresponsive by the patient's sister-in-law
who found both her husband and the patient lying on the
floor.  Patient was brought to the emergency department at
the outside hospital and received Narcan with good effect.
Patient did not receive charcoal and was given intravenous N-
acetyl cysteine for question of Tylenol overdose (although
unlikely) and Ceftriaxone 2 mg intravenous times one.

Per the outside hospital records head CT and chest x-ray were
normal and urine toxicology screen was positive for
benzodiazepines and opiates.  Labs at the outside hospital
showed an increased creatinine of 15, AST of 4600, ALT of
[**2146**], CPK of [**2146**], CPK of 25,000.

In the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 188**] patient was arousable, satting 100 percent on
nonrebreather with an ABG of 7.36/67/167.  The patient,
however, was intubated later on [**2150-5-22**] for hypercarbia
with an ABG of 7.15, PCO2 of 108, and PAO2 of 96.

Patient was seen by the Liver service, as well, and it was
agreed that patient should continue with N-acetyl cysteine
for five more days for hepato protective effects and a
question of ischemic liver injury.  Patient was extubated on
[**2150-5-23**] and was satting well on 2 liters nasal cannula and
had slightly improved mental status upon transfer to the
Medicine floor on [**2150-5-24**].

Patient was also seen by Toxicology while in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit and it was agreed to continue with
anacetylcysteine since patient had increased liver function
tests and an increased total bilirubin.

On transfer to the Medicine floor patient complained of some
lower back pain which is chronic and bilateral knee pain but
otherwise was breathing comfortably.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Asthma.
2. Polysubstance abuse with questionable history of heroin
   use in the past.  Patient has been on Methadone in the
   past but unclear when last taken.
3. Status post GYN surgery.
4. Lower back pain.
5. Depression and anxiety.
6. Question of seizure disorder secondary to head injury
   greater than 10 years ago.  Per the patient's sister the
   patient was apparently on Dilantin which had since been
   discontinued for unknown reasons.
7. Endometriosis status post hysterectomy at age 21.
8. Questionable history of lupus with a positive [**Doctor First Name **] but no
   therapy.  This history was also given by the patient's
   sister.

the patient's sister patient had recently lost her pet dog
and from the trauma of this loss, the patient's husband and
her made this suicide pact.  [**Name (NI) **] husband at the time of
this dictation is currently discharged from the hospital but
had been hospitalized at [**Hospital 5503**] [**Hospital 7637**] Hospital
with question of transfer to the CCU for management of
cardiac issues.  He is currently doing well.

Chest x-ray on [**2150-5-22**] showed persistent small peripheral
opacity in the right lower lobe, small right pleural effusion
versus pleural thickening.

Abdominal ultrasound showed patent pleural vein with no
lesions, no obstruction, positive echogenic kidneys with
appropriate flow, normal liver.  Gallbladder showed
thickening but no signs of cholecystitis,.  No ascites.

CT of the head showed no hemorrhage, normal ventricles and
sulci.  There was a focal region of encephalomalacia in the
right frontal lobe, but otherwise unremarkable.

ASSESSMENT:  47-year-old female with history of substance
abuse and question of seizure disorder in the past, asthma
status post Dilaudid and Klonopin overdose who was admitted
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with mental status change,
rhabdomyolysis, transaminitis, and hypercarbic respiratory
failure now transferred to the Medicine floor after
extubation, improved, for further management.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Medication overdose/Psychiatry:  On transfer to the
   Medicine floor patient was maintained on a one-to-one
   sitter and was followed by Psychiatry throughout her
   hospitalization.  Given her mental status change she was
   not restarted on her antidepressants.  Psych and
   Toxicology both were following the patient.

As far as from a Toxicology standpoint, patient shortly had
her N-acetyl cysteine discontinued on transfer to the
Medicine floor since her liver function tests began to trend
downward.  It was unlikely that patient overdosed on Tylenol,
but the N-acetyl cysteine was kept on per Toxicology
recommendations for hepato protective effects.  Patient
showed no signs of benzodiazepine withdrawal and was
maintained on a Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment
scale for several days and required no Ativan per CIWA scale.
The CIWA scale was subsequently discontinued after events on
[**2150-3-27**], which will be discussed below.  The patient
showed no signs of narcotics withdrawal with no nausea,
vomiting, or any other associated symptoms.  Currently at
time of this dictation patient is awaiting inpatient
psychiatric treatment either at a rehab facility or at [**Hospital1 1444**].

1. Mental status change:  Initially on transfer to the
   Medicine floor patient's mental status seemed slightly
   improved, although patient still was disoriented and
   somewhat confused.  It was thought initially that patient
   most likely had a toxic metabolic encephalopathy from her
   overdose.  Initial EEG, which was checked on [**2150-5-24**],
   was consistent with a diffuse encephalopathy.  Given
   patient's very high liver function tests, decision was
   made to hold off on Dilantin loading on transfer on
   [**2150-5-24**] given possible hepatotoxic effects on Dilantin
   and a questionable history of seizure disorder in the past
   but no evidence of seizures at the time of transfer.

Over the next several days from [**2150-5-25**] to [**2150-5-26**]
patient began to appear more lethargic and her mental status
declined.  She received no Valium to explain her mental
status change, and the Valium per CIWA scale was
discontinued.  A head CT was checked on [**2150-5-25**] to rule
out anoxic brain injury and results showed bilateral
hypodense zones in the main inferior orbital portion of both
frontal lobes as well as a 2 cm triangular area of decreased
absorption in the right frontal lobe suggesting chronic
malasic change in frontal lobes.  Dictation suggested a
questionable history of prior trauma, and thus it was thought
that her head CT was stable.  It was most likely chronic
change from previous head injury.  It was thought that
patient still may likely have a toxic metabolic
encephalopathy.

However, during the course on [**2150-5-26**] patient began to
manifest a worsening mental status and stopped following
commands and was not responding even to sternal rub.  At the
same time patient spiked fevers to 102 and 103.  At 5 p.m. on
[**2150-5-26**] patient became tachycardiac in the 100s.  Systolic
blood pressure rose to the 160s when they had previously been
in the low 100s and temperature rose to 102 with a
respiratory rate of 40.  HEENT exam showed dilated pupils
that were minimally active, scleral icterus with bulging
sclerae.  Funduscopic exam was performed which showed no
papilledema.  Neuro exam:  As mentioned above, patient was
not responding to sternal rub and no withdrawal to pain.  She
was not opening her eyes or following commands.  Her deep
tendon reflexes were still 2 plus throughout with downgoing
Babinski's.

With the mental status change and fever, it was concerning
that patient was either suffering from a seizure,
benzodiazepine withdrawal, or some other neurologic process.
Patient was given 1 mg of Ativan times one for question of
seizure and benzodiazepine withdrawal but with no effect.
Stat chest x-ray showed a question of an aspiration pneumonia
in the right lower lobe, but this was most likely secondary
to mental status change and not the cause of recurrent fever
and mental status.  Blood cultures were drawn which showed no
growth.  Urinalysis was negative.

At this point it was attempted to perform an lumbar puncture.
Head CT had just been performed the night before and there
was no papilledema on funduscopic exam.  It was felt
comfortable to perform the lumbar puncture.  Several attempts
were made by two differential physicians and lumbar puncture
was unsuccessful on the evening of [**2150-5-26**] with no fluid
retrieval.  There were no complications at the attempts.

ABG was also checked at that time and it was 7.54, PCO2 of
29, and PAO2 of 99, suggesting a respiratory alkylosis.  Of
note, patient was also given two units of fresh frozen plasma
for an elevated INR of 1.7 prior to lumbar puncture.

Since patient was and the lumbar puncture was unsuccessful on
the evening of [**2150-5-26**] patient was empirically placed on
Ceftriaxone 2 grams q.d., Vancomycin, and Flagyl for coverage
of aspiration pneumonia.

The patient continued to spike fevers throughout the night of
[**2150-5-27**] and on [**2150-5-28**] patient was not responding to
sternal rub, following commands, or responding to any pain.
Her white count was elevated at 15,000.  A tox screen was
checked which was negative.

At 9 a.m. on [**2150-5-27**] patient had a grand mal seizure with
tonic-clonic movements that were generalized and witnessed by
the nursing staff.  The seizure resolved after a few seconds.
Patient was given Ativan 2 mg times one, but the seizure had
already resolved.  Her temperature was 103 at that time and
her saturations were initially at 95 percent on 2 liters, but
they decreased to 70 percent 4 liters.  Patient was put on
100 percent nonrebreather with only an O2 saturation at 94
percent on nonrebreather.  Anesthesia was called to intubate
the patient for airway protection.  They performed a
nasotracheal intubation most probably secondary to mouth
rigidity.  Patient was emergently transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit after intubation.

Repeat head CT at the MICU showed extensive cerebral edema
primarily in the white matter in a pattern consistent with
reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome.  There were open
ventricles and the basal cisternal  spaces remain visualized.
Neurosurgery was consulted and it was felt that patient would
most likely benefit from some type of intracranial monitoring
device.  Patient was given Mannitol q. 6 hours to keep serum
osms less than 320, four units of fresh frozen plasma, and
had an intracerebral pressure monitor placed as well as an
external ventriculostomy drain.  Patient had cerebrospinal
fluid sample sent from this drain which showed no signs of
infection.  CSF showed only 1 white blood cell and normal
glucose and total protein.

Patient had the drain placed for one day and intracerebral
pressures remained stable and the drain was discontinued on
[**2150-5-29**] by Neurosurgery.  Repeat EEG still showed just
diffuse encephalopathy.  MRI of the head was unrevealing.
Patient was initially started on Dilantin and then
transitioned to Keppra for ease of usage and no monitoring.
Patient was also treated with meningitis doses of Ceftriaxone
2 grams q. day for a total of a seven-day course completed on
[**2150-6-2**] for empiric coverage of meningitis since LP could
not be performed in the acute setting, and patient had
received 24 hours of antibiotics prior to shunt placement and
retrieval of CSF.

Even at the time of this dictation it is still unclear why
patient had this diffuse cerebral edema, and there have been
no clear hypotheses as to why this may have occurred.
Patient was transferred from the ICU back to the Medicine
floor after improvement of her mental status and
discontinuation of the intracerebral pressure monitoring and
patient has been alert, lucid, and her mental status has been
stable.  She is alert enough to give a thorough history and
is aware of her surroundings as well as her caretakers, which
is quite different from her initial presentation.  As far as
her seizure disorder, she will continue with the Keppra and
has not manifested any further seizures.

Fevers:  It is unclear whether patient may have had an
   aspiration pneumonia so she was treated briefly with a
   course of Clindamycin which was subsequently discontinued
   after her second transfer to the Medicine floor since her
   chest x-ray from [**2150-5-28**] was entirely clear.  The
   patient did complete a full course of seven days for a
   treatment of meningitis with Ceftriaxone 2 grams per day
   since it was unclear what precipitated her event.

Patient had a mild low-grade fever on [**2150-6-4**], but this
has resolved and she has had no further infectious issues at
the time of this dictation.  She is currently on no
antibiotics.

Transaminitis:  Patient's liver function tests continued
   to decline and it was thought likely that patient's
   transaminitis and increased INR were secondary to ischemic
   liver injury from her initial event.  These AST and ALT
   are almost at normal levels at the time of this dictation.

Rhabdomyolysis:  Patient's rhabdomyolysis also continued
   to improve throughout the course of her hospitalization.
   At the time of this dictation her CK level is now down to
   500 from a peak of 26,000, and it is felt there is no need
   to follow these since they have continued to trend
   downwards.  Patient was maintained on aggressive
   intravenous hydration at first and now is continuing on
   maintenance fluids since she continues to have poor p.o.
   intake.

Nutrition goal:  Patient initially presented with
   decreased mental status and was not able to take
   nutrition, but since her mental status has improved
   patient has passed a speech and swallow evaluation and is
   tolerating good Pos.  Would continue to encourage fluid
   intake.

Access:  Patient had a right femoral groin line placed
   initially when she was in the Unit and this was
   subsequently discontinued on her first transfer to the
   Medicine floor.  However, when she decompensated with a
   grand mal seizure and was intubated, she had a left IJ
   placed in the MICU.  This left IJ remained in place until
   [**2150-6-4**] when it was discontinued.  The catheter check
   has been sent for culture since the line site was somewhat
   erythematous.  The culture data is still pending at the
   time of this dictation.

DISPOSITION:  Patient has been working with Physical Therapy
and has been regaining her strength daily.  She still
requires some assistance with moving around, but this is felt
that it would likely improve with further strengthening.  The
decision is currently being made at the time of this
dictation whether to transfer the patient to the inpatient
psychiatric unit or to discharge the patient to psychiatric
unit at [**Hospital1 69**].  It has been
confirmed that patient does indeed have insurance, Medicare.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Still unknown at the time of this
dictation but likely to an inpatient psychiatric facility
with a rehab potential.

A discharge addendum will be added to cover the medications
and follow-up plans.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**1-21**]:
In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the diffuse
pulmonary edema has substantially decreased, possibly following
hemodialysis. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists and
there is no definite pleural effusion. Suggestion of an area of
increased opacification at the right base. This could merely
represent asymmetric edema, though the possibility of a
developing consolidation cannot be unequivocally excluded.
.
LUE US [**1-21**]:
IMPRESSION: No DVT in the left upper extremity.
.
L wrist xray [**1-21**]:
There is prominent soft tissue swelling about the wrist,
relatively diffuse, but quite prominent along the dorsum of the
wrist. No fracture, dislocation, degenerative change, focal
lytic or sclerotic lesion, or erosion is identified. No soft
tissue calcification or radiopaque foreign body is identified. A
tiny (1.7 mm) linear density is seen along the dorsum of the
wrist on the oblique view is seen only on that view and is
consistent with a small film artifact.


Brief Hospital Course:
24 yo woman with hx of SLE, ERSD on HD, admitted with
hypertensive urgency and left wrist pain.
.
1. Hypertensive urgency: Patient has an history of malignant
hypertension, with multiple recurrent admissions for
hypertensive urgency.  Patient represented the evening after her
discharge from the hospital and was found to be hypertensive to
254/145.  She was started on nicardipine drip and 1"" nitropaste
and admitted to the ICU for further treatment.  There was no
evidence of end-organ ischemia.  Upon arrival to the ICU she was
given her usual home antihypertensives and the nicardipine was
quickly weaned off.  It was felt that pain and anxiety were both
contributing to her elevated BPs.  Her BP quickly stabilized and
she was called out to the medical floor where her SBP ranged
110-150.  She was continued on nifepidine 90mg daily, aliskerin
150mg [**Hospital1 **], labetalol 900mg TID, hydralazine 100mg TID, and
clonidine 0.3mg + 0.1mg weekly at current doses.  Given her
repeated admissions with hypertensive urgency a meeting was held
between the patient's nephrologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4883**], her ICU
physician and her [**Name9 (PRE) **] to come up with a plan for
treatment in order to try and avoid repeated admissions to the
ICU where she quickly improves with simply continuing her home
medications.  The following plan was drafted and placed in a
note in OMR titled "" Care Protocol"".
.
CARE PROTOCOL:
.
BLOOD PRESSURE MANAGEMENT:
.
For BP > 230/140
1. Hydralazine: 100 mg PO OR 10 mg IV q 20 minutes until blood
pressure back to baseline*.
.
2. Give daily blood pressure medications, if she has not already
taken them before arrival.
.
3. If after one hour of therapy AND/OR evidence of end organ
damage, transfer to the ICU.
.
* Note: Her usual blood pressure is ~ 160/100. Efforts should
not be made to lower blood pressure further, as this may
precipitate end organ hypoperfusion. In the absence of clear
end-organ damage, parenteral blood pressure medications (other
than
hydralazine) are generally not required.
.
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
.
As an outpatient, Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] takes dilaudid 2-4 mg PO q 4
PRN.This is being slowly tapered, she should not be administered
IV pain medications.
.
ANTICOAGULATION:
.
In the absence of bleeding, warfarin does not need to be stopped
on admission. Similarly, in the absence of new thrombosis,
subtherapeutic INR's do not require bridging with IV UFH.
.
2. Fever: Possible sources included line infection,
thombophlebitis, septic arthritis, PNA. Received vanc/zosyn in
ED for possible PNA.  UA without pyuria and urine culture
negative.  CXR also without convinving infiltrate on repeat
PA/Lat so zosyn was discontinued. Patient was complaining of
severe pain at her IV site and was noted to have a small abscess
there which was felt to be the cause of her fever.  She was
continued on IV vanco with HD for 10day course.  She remained
afebrile and did not have a leukocytosis.
.
3. Left wrist pain: Began following IV placement during recent
hospitalization. Likely due to septic thrombophlebitis.  Small
abscess was too small to drain.  This was treated with warm
soaks and prn PO dilaudid.  Vanco was continued for 10 day
course.  L wrist films were enremarkable.
.
4. Left abdominal wall hematoma: Stable on exam from recent
admission. She was  continued on pain management with morphine
7.5mg TID, gabapentin and tylenol as needed for pain.
.
5. SLE:  Continued prednisone at 4 mg PO daily
.
6. ESRD: Continued on regularly scheduled dialysis.
.
7. Anemia: Baseline Hct 26.  Her Hct was mildly decreased from
baseline. Secondary to AOCD and renal failure. There was no
evidence of bleeding.
.
8. SVC thrombus: Known SVC thrombus, therapeutic on coumadin.
Continued warfarin.
.
9. HOCM: evidence of myocardial hypertrophy on recent Echo.
Currently not symptomatic. Echo without evidence of worsening
pericardial effusion.  Continued beta blocker
.
10. Depression/anxiety. Continued Celexa, clonazepam 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
.
11. OSA: Continued CPAP


Medications on Admission:
Clonidine 0.3mg + 0.1mg / 24 hr patch weekly qwednesday

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 24 y.o. F with lupus, Chronic Kidney Disease V
(not currently on HD or PD), and multiple admissions for
hypertensive urgency/emergency, who presented to the ED for
continued R leg pain that starts in her R buttocks and refers
down her R leg.  She describes it as feeling like the pain is
deep within her bone.  The pain was [**10-20**] in the AM, and she
felt like she couldn't get out of bed.  Denies any swelling of
her RLE.  When getting VS in [**Name (NI) **], pt noted to be very
hypertensive at 263/176.  The patient reportedly has baseline
SBPs in 130-170s. She took her hydralazine, aliskirien, and
labetalol at 5 AM on day of admission.  She denies any recent
recrational drug use including cocaine and amphetamines.  She
denies headache, vision changes, double vision, chest pain,
shortness of breath, abdominal pain, BRBPR, dysuria.  During MD
interview, the patient was nauseous and had small amount of
emesis of a recent Coolata.  Pt states that flushing her PD cath
causes a large amount of stomach pain.
.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted from 08.26-29.08. The
patient initially presented to the ED after referral from her
nephrologist's office where she had complaints of right leg pain
and was found to be hypertensive to 250/145. She was admitted
after initiation of a labetalol drip and nitropaste with
improvement in sbp to 180. The patient did receive 2 U of PRBC's
during this hospitalization for baseline anemia. The patient did
have a work-up for her right leg pain complaints with plain
films of the right hip and MRI of the L-spine which did not
reveal an explanation for her symptoms and did rule out
avascular necrosis. The patient received dilaudid for pain
control and was ambulating without pain prior to discharge. In
addition, the patient completed a course of ciprofloxacin for a
positive UA with negative cultures. The patient was unable to
tolerate peritoneal dialysis for unclear reasons. Peritoneal
dialysate culture was negative for infection.

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU course:
EKG showed no change from prior, and CXR showed a suggestion of
RLL/R diaphragm haziness.  IV labetalol was started, and SBPS
dropped from 200s to 130s-160s.  The patient had no symptoms of
end-organ damage.  The renal team was consulted, and recommended
no change to home medication regimen.  The patient was found to
by hypocalcemic, and was started on calcium replacement therapy.
 When stable, patient succesfully switched to PO meds and
transferred to the floor.
.
[**Hospital1 **] history:
.
1. Hypertensive urgency: During the patient's [**Hospital1 **] stay, her
SBPs ranged from 140s-160s during the day, which is her baseline
systolic blood pressure.  She was maintained on her home oral
medication regimen.  At night, she became more hypertensive,
with SBP to the 170s-180s, which was controlled with both IV
hydralazine and PO nifedipine.  PO nifedipine was most
successful at bringing her SBP back to her baseline.  SBP at
discharge was 140.  Throughout her hospitalization, the patient
had no symptoms/signs of hypertensive emergency, including no
seizures, no acute worsening of renal function, no headache,
nausea, visual and mental status disturbances, chest pain,
abdominal pain, or urinary symptoms.  The renal service followed
her throughout her course and did not recommend any changes to
her regimen, but will follow her closely as an outpatient.
.
2. Right leg pain: Upon arrival on the floor, the patient
complained of [**2143-4-15**] pain in R buttock and posterior thigh, much
exacerbated with standing.  Of note, lumbar spine MRI and R hip
XR on most recent admission were both negative.  Her pain was
intermittent, likely secondary to sciatica, and had resolved by
the time of her discharge.  Her pain when she was symptomatic
was controlled well with PO dilaudid.  If the pain recurs, an
MRI of the right hip can be considered to evaluate for
osteonecrosis.
.
3. UTI: The patient had a urinalysis suggestive of UTI, though
she remained asymptomatic throughout.  She was treated with a
three day course of ciprofloxacin.  Her urine culture showed
mixed flora consistent with skin contamination.
.
4. ESRD: The patient has end-stage renal disease due to her
lupus.  The patient's creatinine remained stable at 7.9-8.4
throughout her hospitalization, which was similar to her
baseline renal function.  She was followed by the renal consult
service.  Her potassium remained stable.  Her calcium was low
during admission, and supplemental calcium was given in addition
to starting Calcitriol.  She was not dialyzed through her PD
catheter secondary to discomfort, but may reinitiate PD as an
outpatient.  Her laboratories will be checked as an outpatient
in renal clinic.
.
5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit remained near her baseline
low 20s throughout her stay.  She has anemia from chronic kidney
disease and chronic disease.  The patient is not on Epopoeitin
as an outpatient, likely due to her malignant hypertension.
.
6. Prior SVC thrombus: The patient has a reported history of
prior thrombus related to catheter placement in [**2139**], and was
maintained on warfarin with INR goal 2.5 to 3.0.
.
7. Systemic lupus erythematosus: No active issues.  The
patient's home prednisone regimen was continued.

Brief Hospital Course:
24 y.o female with SLE, ESRD on HD and malignant hypertension
who presents with HTN and SOB aftering missing HD.
.
# Malignant hypertension/hypertensive urgency: The patient has a
well-documented history of paroxysmal hypertension believed to
possibly be related to pain, anxiety, narcotic withdrawal and
poor medication and HD compliance. Has previously presented with
BP up to 260/160 but most often without evidence of end-organ
ischemia, as she did for this admission. Pt was treated per OMR
hypertensive protocol created by the patient's primary
providers, with a goal SBP of 160-180. With short course of IV
antihypertensives and hemodialysis, pt's BP fell appropriately
and was well maintained on oral outpt regimen of clonidine,
labetalol, aliskiren, nifedipine.
.
# ESRD: Pt was followed by the renal service and underwent HD
without any complications. Pt states she would like to
reconsider peritoneal dialysis as she is experiencing increased
fatigue since instituting HD.  She will discuss this further
with the Renal team as an outpatient.
.
# SLE: Pt was continued on her home dose of prednisone with no
sign of SLE flair.
.
# Coagulopathy/history of DVT: Patient on lifetime
anticoagulation for hx of multiple thrombotic events. Pt was
continued on coumadin.
.
# Pain management:  Pt was treated with PO dilaudid for her
abdominal pain, as recommended per her OMR protocol. She asked
for IV dilaudid multiple times but there was no clinical
indication.  She was also continued on gabapentin.
.
# Anemia: Secondary to AOCD and renal failure.  The patietns Hct
remained stable in the low 20s during admission.  No PRBC
infusions were needed.
.
# Depression/anxiety: Continued Celexa, clonazepam 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **]

Brief Hospital Course:
57M s/p liver [**Month/Day/Year **] [**2123-7-2**] (POD 20) presented with nausea
and diarrhea x1 day, dysphagia, dyspnea on exertion or when
lying flat, and dysuria. He was admitted to the [**Month/Day/Year **]
service under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Baseline labs were drawn and diet was
restricted to clear liquid. Cellcept was held, stool was sent
for culture and C diff. UA was WNL. An EGD was done
demonstrating multiple superficial lower esophageal ulcerations
above the GE junction as well as findings consistent with
duodenitis. Protonix was increased to [**Hospital1 **]. Remeron was started
for complaints of poor appetite and depressed mood. Diarrhea
resolved and stool cultures were negative.

An [**7-23**] abdominal U/S was done which showed hepatic artery
stnosis. Diagnostic hepatic angiogram demonstrating a segment of
high grade stenosis of the main hepatic artery distal to the GDA
with a focal associated pseudoaneurysm.

Angiography and attempt to stent by IR demonstrated the
critically stenotic segment of the main hepatic artery and
associated pseudoaneurysm. Stents were deployed within the main
hepatic artery across the area of concern, with immediate
thrombosis and only minimally successful
thrombolysis/thrombectomy.  The stent remained partially
thrombosed without good flow and patency. Anticoagulation was
then started with ASA, plavix an heparin drip.

He returned to IR the followig day for repeat angiography and
potential re-intervention. This showed complete thrombosis of
the hepatic artery stents, with
unsuccessful attempts at recanalization.  Additionally, there
was complete thrombosis of the adjacent pseudoaneurysm.

He continued on his anticoagulation and was bridged to coumadin
and continued his ASA and plavix. His LFT's continued to be
normal throughout this hospitalization. He was also not
encephalopathic. He had edema and increased ascites after his
procedure and received multiple paracentesis and was started on
lasix.  On [**8-2**], his hct dropped to 21.8 and there was concern
for a retroperitoneal hematoma. A CT scan was negative for
hematoma and he was transfused 2U pRBC and his hct responded
appropriately. A hemolytic work up was also negative.

He was taken to the OR by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**8-4**] for umbilical hernia
repair with mesh. A JP drain was also placed at the time for his
ascites requiring multiple paracentesis.  He also received
albumin replacements for his high JP outputs. On POD 2, the
patient complained of obstipation and emesis. A KUB was done
demontrating an Ileus and he was managed appropriately wth NG
tube, IVF and NPO.

His ileus improved, he was placed on a low sodium diet and
tolerated it well. Over time, his edema improved, the JP output
decreased and the executive decision was made  to stop his
coumadin before discharge..

He was discharged on [**8-12**] tolerating regular diet, having regular
bowel movements, reduced JP output to 650cc, improved edema, and
ambulating. He received JP teaching, went home with VNA,and was
instructed to get his biweekly labs from QUEST. He continued
only ASA and plavix for anticoagulation. He is to follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic on [**8-18**] with his JP output recordings and to
be seen in the [**Hospital 73840**] clinic in the near future.

three days and was called out to the floor on [**1-14**]. At that
point his HCT had remained stable for several days and he had
had no episodes of further coffee ground emesis and remained
guiac negative.

[**2173-1-12**] CXR
Allowing for apical lordotic projection and low lung volumes,
the heart size and mediastinal contours are within normal
limits. A nasogastric tube is present, but the distal tip is
difficult to identify due to underpenetrated technique. There is
a probable small right pleural effusion extending into the major
fissure. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.

[**2173-1-12**] Repeat CXR
Compared with earlier the same day, a left subclavian central
line has been placed -- the tip overlies the proximal SVC. No
pneumothorax is identified. An NG tube is present, tip overlying
fundus. There is p atchy atelectasis at left base, in the
setting of low lung volumes.

[**2173-1-12**] CT Abd
IMPRESSION: Acute pancreatitis, possibly with very slight
worsening of inflammatory changes in the anterior pararenal
space compared to the examination performed earlier today. A
portion of the pancreatic head demonstrates decreased
enhancement on the contrast enhanced images, which may represent
early changes of necrosis.

CT Abd pelvis [**2173-1-19**]
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of acute pancreatitis, without
evidence of new gas or fluid collections, or new areas of
necrosis.
2. Small left pleural effusion and atelectasis with resolution
of the right pleural effusion.

CXR [**2173-1-20**] IMPRESSION: Chest clear. No infiltrates. No evidence
of pneumonia

CT of Sinuses [**2173-1-21**]
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of sinusitis or mucosal
thickening involving the maxillary, sphenoid, ethmoid, or
frontal sinuses. The optic struts are bilaterally aerated. The
right cribriform plate is 1 mm superior to the left. There is
mild right-sided nasal septal deviation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of sinusitis.

ECHO [**2173-1-22**] Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Right ventricular chamber
size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal study. No echocardiographic evidence of
endocarditis

[**2173-1-24**] RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 9.2 cm, and
the left kidney measures 10.5 cm. There is no hydronephrosis,
renal masses, or renal calculi identified. No perinephric fluid
collections are seen.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis.

[**2173-1-24**] CT ABD/PELVIS IMPRESSION
1. No evidence of hemorrhage within the abdomen or pelvis.
2. Stable appearance of peripancreatic stranding and fluid
without evidence of drainable focal fluid collections. These
findings are consistent with acute pancreatitis.
3. Interval resolution of left pleural effusion and improvement
in aeration of the left lower lobe.


Brief Hospital Course:
45 y/o male with HIV/AIDS, HCV, who presented to the hospital
with acute pancreatitis likely related to EtOH ingestion and
question of a possible UGIB given reported history of coffee
ground emesis. The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course will be reviewed by
problem list.

#Pancreatitis: On admission the patient had a markedly elevated
lipase consistant with pancreatitis, the etiology of which was
thought to be most likely ETOH induced. The patient's abdominal
CT on admission did not show any evidence of pseudocyst
formation and subsequent repeat Abdominal CT's during the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course also were negative for pseudocyst
formation. On initial presentation, both GI and Surgery were
consulted. The patient was initially managed in the MICU were he
received agressive IVF hydration and was maintained NPO and
given TPN. The patient's abdominal pain was slow to resolve and
therefore his diet was advanced very slowly. At the time of
discharge the patient was tolerating PO without difficulty
taking both his meds and food.
.
#GI Bleed : Per patient report on admission he had had several
episodes of coffee ground emesis. In the hospital however, no
further episodes were noted. This emesis was most likely ETOH
gastritis or [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear. GI decided to not do an EGD
during this admission. The patient's HCT remained stable
throughout his hospital stay and he was transitioned from IV
protonix to PO at discharge.

#ETOH withdrawal: The patient was maintained on a CIWA scale to
monitor for signs of withdrawal while in house. Initially he was
maintained on standing valium IV, which was subsequently
discontinued.

#HTN: The patient's HTN may be related to his EtOH use history.
He was treated with metoprolol and hydralazine IV while NPO, but
when he was able to take PO meds he was transitioned to PO
atenolol with good effect.

#HIV: The patient's HAART was held at the advice of his ID
physician since several of these medications may cause
pancreatitis. He will be restarted on therapy as an outpatient
when his acute illness has improved.

#CAD: The patient is s/p cath with PCI stent. In the setting of
his GI bleed, ASA was held and his statin was also held because
of his acute pancreatitis. These will be addressed during the
patient's outpatient follow up appointment.

#FEN: The patient was initially maintained on TPN while NPO. An
NGT was never placed because it was thought the patient's bowel
function would return quickly because of his good response to
IVF hydration. He initially received massive electrolyte
repleation during the acute phase of his pancreatitis and while
on the floor continued to have daily electrolyte monitoring and
repletion. At the time of discharge he was tolerating PO without
difficulty.

#ID: Shortly after transfer to the hospital floor from the MICU
the patient developed a fever. A CXR revealed a pneumonia, which
was treated with levaquin. The patient continued to spike high
fevers, however, and was therefore empirically started on both
vancomycin and flagyl in addition to the levaquin. His central
line was d/c'd and cultures were negative. UA was negative,
blood cultures were negative. ECHO did not show any evidence of
endocarditis and since CT was negative for sinusitis. The
patient was then taken off all antibiotics and his fever
disappeared. As a result it was thought the source was most
likely drug related, likely [**12-30**] vancomycin. The patient had been
afebrile for >72 with a normal WBC count at the time of
discharge.

#MS: After transfer from the MICU the patient began to complain
of increasing abdominal pain. On admission it was reported and
the patient verified he had a long history of chronic pain
problems. [**Name (NI) **] also stated he was taking methadone daily ~80mg in
addition to neurontin and a fentanyl patch. In the MICU the
patient had been receiving dilaudid IV for pain control. He was
transitioned to his medications that he per report had been
taking. The patient was noted to be very somnolent by the
nursing staff and house staff. Near the end of the [**Hospital 228**]
hospital stay he was found with RR of 12/min and unable to be
aroused. He was given Narcan IV and his mental status improved.
The patient was also quite constipated [**12-30**] all the pain
medication he had been receiving. After this episode his pain
medications were drastically altered and he also received
kayexelate which lowered his K and caused him to have multiple
bowel movements. The patient was discharged on methadone, but at
a much lower dose and was maintained on his fentanyl patch. His
PMD will adjust his pain medications as appropriate.

CXR ([**2144-6-9**]): UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The heart size is
normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
Except for mild bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis, the lungs
are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is visualized. Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
Multiple clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen denote
prior cholecystectomy. Dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is
present.
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
.
CXR [**6-10**]
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2144-6-9**].
.
There is a linear opacity below the left hemidiaphragm that
could potentially
represent free intraperitoneal air, but these findings were not
redemonstrated
on the dedicated decubitus view, thus unlikely to represent true
pathology.
.
Compared to the prior study, there is no interval development of

consolidations worrisome for infectious process.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette including dextroscoliosis is
unchanged.
.
LAT DECUB [**6-10**]

Lateral decubitus was obtained.

There is no evidence of free air within the limitations of this
study seen.
There is minimal degree of left pleural effusion. There is
otherwise no
change since the prior study demonstrated.
.
[**6-11**]
.
Comparison is made to prior study performed a day earlier.
.
Right upper lobe opacity is either new or more conspicuous than
on prior
studies and is consistent with infectious process/pneumonia.
Bilateral
pleural effusions are small.
Bibasilar opacities could be atelectasis. There is no evident
pneumothorax.
The aorta is tortuous.
.
Cardiac size is mildly enlarged.
.
IMPRESSION: Right upper lobe pneumonia.
.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.



Brief Hospital Course:
57F depression, prior psychosis, prior suicidal attempts,
diabetes mellitus type II, admitted following suicide attempt.
.
#. Suicide attempt: Reports ingesting large quantity of
gabapentin, in addition to smaller quantities of methadone and
trazadone. Toxicology screen also positive for cocaine.
Gabapentin toxicity manifests largely as somnolence; patient
very somnolent in ED, and intermittently in ICU, where she was
transferred for somnolence and hypotension.  ECG and tele WNL
throughout the admission.  Toxicology service consulted and
recommended serial ECGs and supportive care.  Psychiatry
consulted, recommended 1:1 sitter which was continued throughout
the admission.  Mental status improved throughout the admission
and pt denied suicidal ideation.  She was given olanzapine and
ativan for agitation, with some effect.  Pt had some continued
episodes of agitation and paranoia, was evaluated for psych
placement.  After being seen by psychiatry they recommended an
inpatient psychiatry placement and underwent a bed search with
the BEST team, after a bed became available was transferred for
further care.
.
#. Prior alcohol abuse: Patient reports being free of alcohol
for 3 years; relapsed yesterday.  Was given banana bag followed
by initiation of MVI, folate, however tox screen negative for
EtOH.  Given low likelihood for alcohol withdrawal and so as to
not cloud recovery from above ingestions, no CIWA scale was
initiated.
.
#. Acute kidney injury: presumed to be pre-renal in setting of
somnolence and poor PO intake, improved with fluids.
.
#. Diabetes mellitus, type II: Currently insulin-dependent.  Her
evening dose of lantus was decreased to 20 units, which she
tolerated well with glucose ranging 80s-100s.  QACHS blood
glucose checks, coverage with Humalog sliding scale as per her
home regimen.
.
#. Productive cough: No evidence of infiltrate while in the ICU,
however pt had upper lobe infiltrate while on the floor, and
therefore was started on a course of levofloxicin, to be
continued for 3 days after discharge.
.
#. Skin wound: Healing. No surrounding erythema or purulence
drainage.  Continued wound care.
.
#  Blood pressure: hypotensive in the ICU, improved with fluid
bolus, lisinopril held.  She was hypertensive while on the floor
in the setting of agitation, restarted on home dose of
lisinopril.  After that point in time her blood pressures were
well controlled on the floor.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 24 year old female with a history of SLE, ESRD on
HD, h/o malignant HTN, SVC syndrome, PRES, prior ICH, with
frequent admission for hypertensive urgency/emergency, with
chronic abdominal pain that presented to the ED [**7-12**] with
critically high blood pressure and dyspnea. She was recently
discharged on [**7-8**] for hypertensive urgency and dyspnea.   She
was treated with labetolol gtt, [**Month/Year (2) 2286**], and her home
medications with improvement of her BP. She was discharged home
in stable condition on [**7-8**]. She had been doing well at home,
but missed her HD session on [**7-10**] due to transportation issues.
She has been taking her medications without any difficulty. On
the morning of admission, she noted increase dyspnea, and had a
dry cough, although this is not particularly new. She presented
to the ER for dyspnea.  She continues to have the chronic
abdominal pain which is unchanged, and is controlled right now.


In the emergency department, VS= 98.1, 240/140, 128, 30, 96%RA.
On initial evaluation, she was noted to have SBP 70s on the
right arm, 240s on the left arm. She did not complain of any
pain. She underwent CTA torso to eval for dissection which was
negative for dissection or PE. The imaging showed persistent SVC
thrombus. There was also note of bilateral ground glass and
nodularities therefore was given levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1. She
was given labetalol IV, then started on a labetalol gtt. Her BP
remained elevated, therefore she was transferred to the ICU for
BP control and then [**Month/Year (2) 2286**]. She was also given dilaudid 1 mg
IV x 1 as well.

Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the MICU and treated for malignant
hypertension.  She was given hemodialysis and her blood pressure
stabilized.  She was transferred to the medical floor.  She
continued to receive [**Known lastname 2286**] Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
On [**7-16**], she had a paracentesis of her abdomen.  She is
complaining of focal tenderness around the point of insertion.
On [**7-17**], she was transferred back to the MICU because of stridor
that was treated with Heliox.  She was stabilized, and came back
to the floor on [**7-19**].  On [**7-19**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a venogram.  On
[**7-23**],  an angiography intervention for an occlusion of her left
brachiocephalic vein was discontinued because her occlusion was
not as drastic as prior imaging indicated when tested with a 22
gauge needle.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was discharged on [**7-23**] with stable
blood pressures and abdominal pain controlled.

Brief Hospital Course:
24 y/o female with h/o SLE, ESRD on HD, malignant HTN, h/o SVC
syndrome, PRES, prior ICH, and recent SBO, presented to ED on
[**7-12**] for dyspnea and hypertensive urgency.

1. hypertensive urgency - pt presented to ER with SBP in 240s
and c/o dyspnea. Her blood pressures were reported as unequal
and CTA in ER was done. This study showed no signs of
dissection. Pt's blood pressure was controlled with labetalol
gtt.  At time of transfer, she denied CP and SOB. CE's were
flat. She was started on her home BP regimen of oral labetalol
on [**2142-7-15**], and nifedipine/hydralazine/aliskerin soon after
admission.  Pt was also continued on her HD regimen for ESRD,
for volume control.
.
2. angioedema - pt developed facial swelling and shortness of
breath while on medical floor.  She was taken to ICU and
responded favorably to Heliox.  Patient returned to floor and
has been comfortably breathing since.  Given history of SVC,
venogram was ordered that did not indicate a complete occlusion
of the left brachiocephalic vein, as previously thought, with
help of 22 gauge needle.

3. cough: pt presented with chronic cough/dyspnea without
fevers. Chest CT revealed bilateral infiltrates and
nodularities, noted possibly infectious vs edema. Pt was started
on vanc/zosyn given recent hospitalization, brief temp spike,
and pulm infiltrates. Abx were stopped after cultures were neg.
At time of transfer, pt's dyspnea was largely resolved and these
findings were felt to be more consistent with edema given
hypertensive urgency.
.
4. chronic abdominal pain - pt has had chronic abdominal pain,
which was well controlled at time of transfer. She was continued
on her current outpt pain regimen of po dilaudid, fentanyl
patch, lidoacine patch. Her LFTs and lipase were wnl. She had no
signs of SBO.
.
5. bacteremia - GPC in pairs and clusters; started on vanco on
[**2142-7-12**].
.
6. Ascites - unclear etiology and new findings for her.  Pt is
to get workup with liver team as outpatient.  Her [**Date Range 2286**] seems
to have slightly improved this finding. Her coags were
unremarkable. She was seen by Hepatology in house who did not
have any specific recommendations at this time but asked to see
her in follow up as an outpatient.
.
7. ESRD on HD - HD SaTuTh,. Pt was continued on her HD regimen
while in house. Sevelamer was continued as well.
.
8. anemia/pancytopenia - chronic anemia, baseline pancytopenia,
likely [**2-12**] CKD and SLE, currently above baseline, though has h/o
GIB.  Pt's pancytopenia remained stable; C3 and C4 studies were
performed and it was felt that her SLE was not active at this
time. Guiac stools were neg.  EPO was continued at HD.
.
9. h/o gastric ulcer - PPI was continued throughout
hospitalization.
.
10. SLE - pt was continued on home regimen of prednisone 4mg po
qdaily.
.
11. h/o SVC thrombosis - patient's warfarin was discontinued
after discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4883**].  She frequently is outside
of therapeutic range on this medication and given the suspected
problems with medication compliance, it was felt it was safer to
discontinue it altogether.
.
12. seizure disorder - pt was continued on home regimen keppra
1000 mg PO 3X/WEEK (TU,TH,SA).
.
13. depression - pt was continued on her home celexa.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 49yo M with HTN, alcohol abuse c/b w/d, h/o vicodin abuse
on methadone, admitted with cellulitis.
.
1. Alcohol withdrawal:  Patient stated he had been drinking
tequila over the past several months in an effort to relieve his
LE pain.  He was initially admitted to the MICU for alcohol
withdrawal requiring high doses of benzodiazepines.  On the
floor, he was maintained on a CIWA scale with prn Valium.  He
had no signs or symptoms of DTs.  His CIWA scale was
discontinued on [**11-9**] as he had not required Valium for over 40
hours.  He was continued on MVI, thiamine, and folate.  He was
seen by Social Work to address his alcohol abuse.  He declined
alcohol abuse rehab programs.
.
2. LE edema/Cellulitis:  He has severe LE vascular insufficiency
and cellulitis.  He was treated with Unasyn for his cellulitis.
He was followed by Vascular Surgery.  His dressing changes were
monitored by Wound Care.  He was given Unaboots and maintained
on Unasyn, for a 6 week course as discussed below.  His WBC
count was normal on discharge.  He was discharged with a plan
for Vascular Surgery follow up in 2 weeks.
.
3. L Ankle deformity:  History of fracture of left ankle, was
set but not surgically corrected as he did not follow up.  He
presented this admission with destructive changes and overlying
cellulitis.  He underwent x-rays, CT, bone scan, and MRI in an
effort to determine whether he had osteomyelitis, all of which
were inconclusive.  It was therefore decided to treat him with
IV antibiotics for a total of 6 weeks, a sufficient course to
treat osteomyelitis.  Ortho/Foot and Ankle service followed him
and determined he would need ankle fusion at some point, but as
an outpatient once his cellulitis has resolved.  He was
discharged with the plan for Ortho follow up in [**2-13**] weeks.  He
was non-weight-bearing on his LLE.
.
4. Acute renal failure:  His creatinine trended up to 1.7 during
his hospitalization.  He had good urine output, and was afebrile
and without urinary symptoms.  The most likely etiology was
thought to be med effect from HCTZ, as he was on a high dose for
LE edema and was noncompliant as an outpatient for the last
year.  His FEUrea was calculated to be 24.6%, suggesting a
prerenal ARF.  His HCTZ was initially decreased to an
antihypertensive dose (25mg qd), and then discontinued.  His
creatinine subsequently improved to 1.2 on discharge.  He was
discharged to follow up with his PCP.
.
5. H/o vicodin abuse:  He worked as a pharmacist for several
years and thus had access to vicodin.  He is in a methadone
program as an outpatient.  He was maintained on his outpatient
regimen after his dose was verified with the treatment program.

.
6. HTN: He was prescribed atenolol and HCTZ (at LE edema doses)
as an outpatient, but reported decreased compliance over the
past year.  He was maintained on metoprolol and HCTZ (at an
antihypertensive dose) during his hospitalization with good
control of his BP.  His HCTZ was discontinued secondary to ARF.
He was discharged on metoprolol.
.
7. Hypoxia:  He had an oxygen requirement and some episodes of
desaturation overnight.  His CXRs were negative for pneumonia.
He had a V/Q scan that was normal.  His O2 requirement improved
with deep breathing and incentive spirometry.  Possible
etiologies include restrictive pulmonary disease secondary to
body habitus, OSA/obesity-hypoventilation, and/or underlying
COPD secondary to smoking.  On discharge, he had good O2
saturation on room air.  He was discharged to new PCP follow up,
to consider PFTs and further investigation of his underlying
pulmonary status.

Brief Hospital Course:
24F with h/o SLE, ESRD on HD, malignant HTN, h/o SVC syndrome
was admitted to the MICU with dyspnea and hypertensive emergency
with SBP 280s.  She has frequent admissions for hypertensive
emergency.  See below for specific hospital course on each
problem.
.
# HTN Urgency/Emergency: Patient was admitted directly to the
ICU with shortness of breath and hypertension.  One of her
clonidine patches had fallen off and it was likely that this
could have caused some of the elevation in BP.  She was started
on a nitro gtt in the ED, but in the MICU she was placed on a
labetolol drip.  Lactate on admission was 0.9 and there was no
evidence of new end organ damage.  She was restarted on all of
her home meds (except her qhs nifedipine) and transferred to the
floor the next day with SBP in the 160s.  During her admission
renal was follwing and recommended that she be given a home
blood pressure cuff.  For SBP > 200, she will have hydralazine
100mg PO.  She will re-check in 30 mins with instructions to
repeat up to three times before seeking medical attention in the
Emergency room.  She was also given dilaudid prn for her pain,
which is a continuation of her outpatient pain regimen.  She did
not require hydralazine IV prn on the floor.  Prior to discharge
her evening dose of nifedipine was restarted and she recieved
hemodialysis.  She remained normotensive during the rest of her
admission and was discharged with stable vital signs.

# Dyspnea: Patient was admitted with dyspnea, which improved
with resolution of her hypertension.  She required supplementary
oxygen intermitantly during the admission but was saturation >92
% on RA at discharge.  There was concern for infection in the ED
and was given as above, likely secondary to pulmonary edema +/-
infection given fever, cough and infiltrate.  She was started on
vancomycin in the ED, but that was discontinued and she was not
put on additional antibiotics.  She remaine afebrile throughout
the rest of her stay.  Blood cultures were negative at time of
discharge.
.
# Fever: Concerning for PNA given complaints of dyspnea and
cough and infiltrate on CXR. Other possible etiologies onclude
line infection given indwelling femoral HD line, however, the
femoral line had been exchanged during previous admission.  See
above course in dyspnea section.
.
# Chronic abdominal pain - abdominal pain was well controlled
throughout the admission with  PO dilaudid.  She was moving her
bowels throughout the stay.  Lidocaine patch was also
continued.ontinue neurontin per HD.
.
# ESRD on HD - HD SaTuTh. Sevelamer was continued during the
hospitalization.  She recieved hemodialysis on Thursday, [**8-16**]
prior to discharge.
.
# anemia - Pt has chronic anemia, baseline pancytopenia, likely
[**2-12**] CKD and SLE, currently at/slightly below baseline, though
has h/o GIB. HCT 23 here, most recently 22 on discharge [**8-7**].
We continued EPO per renal and was administered 2 units PRBC's
prior to hemodialysis.
.
# h/o gastric ulcer - continue PPI.
.
# SLE - continue home regimen of prednisone 4mg po qdaily.
.
# h/o SVC thrombosis - Now off anticoagulation secondary to
noncompliance with coumadin
.
# seizure disorder - continue keppra 1000 mg PO 3X/WEEK
(TU,TH,SA).

History of Present Illness:
CC:
HPI: 57M h/o HTN, HCV, heroin and alcohol abuse, admitted w/
SOB, rhabdomyolysis, and renal failure. Pt was in USOH until
[**2112-2-13**] when drank quart of gin and took 400 mg methadone in
suicide attempt. Woke up on [**2112-2-15**] and called EMS because of ?
respiratory distress and because of desire to seek treatment
since regrets decision to commit suicide.  Patient is divorced,

hallucinations with visible tremors, sweats.  Serum EtOH 27,
HCO3 16, Cr 3.2, anion gap 15, CK 6950, tox screen otherwise
negative.  SBP increased to 270.   Pt received lorazepam 2 mg IV
x 3, 2 L NS, banana bag, and was eventually started on lorazepam
per CIWA scale and D5W HCO3 @ 150 cc/hr.  SBP decreased to 200s
with lorazepam.  HCO3 improved to 25. Given metoprolol 5 mg IV
prior to transfer to floor.
.
MICU course: In the MICU, patient was monitored on a CIWA scale.
He developed some hypoxia on hospital day 2 and a V/Q span
showed low likelihood for a PE. CT chest on [**2-15**] had shown
bibasilar opacities that could represent atelectasis or
consolidations and he was started on zosyn for coverage of
pneumonia with aspiration as a possibility. His creatinine
steadily trended down with hydration. He was followed by psych
and addiction services. He was given metoprolol to treat
hypertension, which was thought likely secondary to withdrawal

Brief Hospital Course:
57M h/o HTN, HCV, heroin and alcohol abuse, p/w EtOH withdrawal,
rhabdomyolysis, ARF s/p suicide attempt with EtOH and methadone.
.
1. Long QTc: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was initially admitted to the ICU for
close monitoring of his prolonged QTc (446 on arrival in the
ED).  This was likely due to methadone overdose and resolved
during his ICU course. His methadone was restarted on [**2-19**] after
EKG showed QTc normal.
.
2. EtOH withdrawal:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] symptoms of withdrawl were
treated with lorazepam/diazepam prn per CIWA scale.  His
hypertension and tachycardia were managed with a beta-blocker
given his risk of end-organ damage.  He was treated with
nutritional supplements with thiamine, folate, and Vitamin B12.
.
3. HTN: Patient was intially hypertensive with systolic bp's
from 180-200.  This was likely the manifestation chronic HTN
compounded by adrenergic surge in setting of w/d.  In addition
to treating underlying withdrawal, HTN was treated directly with
beta blockade and hydralizine given concern for hypertensive
stroke and other end organ damage.  Until he was able to take
oral medications, he was treated with IV metoprolol and IV
hydralazine.  Once able to take PO medications, he was
transitioned to oral metoprolol and hydralizine. Norvasc was
added for blood pressure control. He was on low dose lisinopril
and his lopressor was converted to atenolol to be started on
transfer to [**Hospital1 **] 4.
.
4. ARF: Likely [**2-26**] to rhabdomyolysis in setting of LOC following
overdose, burn, or possible preadmission seizure.  Baseline
creatinine is unknown although may be elevated in setting of
chronic HTN. His renal failure improved with aggressive
hydration with resolution of his metabolic acidosis and
improvement of his creatinine from 3.2 at admission to 1.3 at
the time of transfer to psych [**Hospital1 **] which we suspect is his
baseline.  CK was followed serially with progressive decline
throughout his course.
.
5. L arm pain/swelling/unilateral weakness: Likely tramautic [**2-26**]
to fall at time of LOC.  Patient had a negative workup for
c-spine trauma or cortical etiology of unilateral weakness.  He
was seen by neuro who felt his weakness to be consistent with
peripheral neuropathy from compression and less likely a
radiculopathy.  Plain films of the wrist and humerus were
negative.  There was no evidence of compartment syndrome.
.
6. Suicidal ideation: Patient expresses regret about suicide
attempt and desires counseling and psychiatric support.
Psychiatry has followed the patient throughout his course and
will accept the patient on their service when he is medically
stable.
.
7. Opiate addiction: Methadone maintenance dose confirmed with
clinic as 57.5 mg qd. Methadone was held while in ICU per psych
recs and restarted when the patient was medically stable.
.
8. Hepatitis: Likely [**2-26**] EtOH, although patient has HCV.  There
was no evidence of hepatic failure or cirrhosis.  LFTs were
followed serially with progressive improvement. The patient had
a RUQ U/S which demonstrated fatty liver and renal cysts. This
can be followed up as an outpatient. His hepatitis serologies
are pending at the time of transfer. Please follow up and
vaccinate for hep A and hep B as appropriate.  Feel free to
consult med consult to assist with this if necessary. He reports
2 negative HIV tests in the past 5 years and reports solely
protected sexual intercourse since then. Denies other high risk
behaviors and thus declined an HIV test.
.
9. Pancreatitis:  Likely [**2-26**] EtOH.  Amylase and lipase initially
improved but were trending up at the time of transfer.  However,
the patient had no clinical signs or symptoms of pancreatitis.
.
10. L back burn: Unclear etiology. Topical silver sulfadiazine
was applied with good effect and the patient was followed for
the possibilty of evolving cellulitis.  On the day of discharge
his wound were clean with good red granulation tissue without
signs of cellulitis.


Medications on Admission:
1. atenolol 100 mg qd (stopped 1 year ago due to poor access to
[**Hospital1 2177**] pharmacy)

TEE [**2120-11-29**]


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 51 year old woman with history of asthma,
hypertension, chronic knee/back pain on chronic narcotics who
was admitted to an OSH 6 days ago with lethargy. She was found
by her son as minimally arousable on [**2120-11-19**]. The son called
EMS the following day after being asked to do so by her husband
who lives in [**Name (NI) 3844**]. The patient was admitted to the OSH
for evaluation of the lethargy that was presumably due to the
narcotics. Urine tox + for benzos and barbituates. Her mental
status improved with administration of Narcan both by EMS and by
the ED physicians. Subsequent to that she was notably
hypertensive that was attributed to clonidine withdrawal. A head
CT was done to further evaluated her mental status which showed
old infarct as well as subacute infarcts. The patient had been
hypokalemic at the OSH with low of 2.6. A psychiatry consult
evaluated her and placed her on a Section 12 given the concern
for an intentional overdose. It was the opinion of the
consulting psychiatrist that she would likely benefit from an
inpatient psychiatry stay once medically stabilized. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Prior to transfer
her blood pressure was 140/82 after receiving oral and topical
medications.
.
The patient states that she took too many of her pills because
she ""just felt like it."" She denies wanting to hurt herself or
kill herself. She denies worsening feelings of depression.

ROS: no headache. no chest pain. no shortness of breath. cough
produtive of green or white sputum. no blood in sputum. no
nausea or vomiting. no pain with urinating.

she had an overdose on diet pills. This was two prior to
hospitalization when she took an overdose of over-the-counter
diet pills. Long history of self-injury (cutting, cigarrette
burns which per recent neurology note she connects this behavior
with a history of trauma where she was raped twice as an adult

represents acute or subacute infarcts. However, if there is
concern for an infectious process, this may represent
cerebritis.

ASSESSEMENT/PLAN: 51 year old woman with chronic pain, COPD,
depression, cluster B disorders p/w lethargy in setting of
methadone overdose, complicated by hypertension, found to have
subacute CVA.
.
# CVA: Pt noted to have subacute stroke on imaging involving the
right insula and adjacent R temporal lobe with clinical evidence
of L facial droop, L pronator driift and distal UE weakness. She
was followed closely by the neurology service, concern for an
embolic stroke. TTE & carotid ultrasound were unremarkable. TEE
showed complex atheroma in aortic arch and pt was continued on
aspirin 325mg daily, which she had not been in the past -
neurology held off on coumadin due to high risk for bleeding.
She has also been started on Lipitor. CTA was not performed due
to her dye allergy with anaphylaxis. PT& OT eval for
rehabilitation. Speech improved and per swallow examination
increased pt to ground solid food & thin liquids. She should be
re-evaluated and her diet advanced. Pt is scheduled to follow up
with Dr.[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2530**] [**Name (STitle) **] in neurology for followup.
.
# Hypertension: Pt with labile HTN during hospitalization, was
only on single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] Nifedipine at home. She was started on
Labetolol, captopril & clonidine to control SBP <140, clonidine
was stopped. BP currently well controlled on 3 agents,
labetalol, nifedipine and lisinopril with SBP ranging 120-140's.
.
# SI/depression: On admission, pt was actively suicidal in the
ICU and psychiatry was consulted. s/p overdose with narcotics,
benzos. Althought Section 12 on admission, requiring 1:1 sitter,
prior to discharge reevaluation revealed no SI. She was
restarted on celexa 20mg qhs. Psych felt that she did not
warrant inpatient therapy and recommended outpatient psych
followup with Dr.[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1681**].

pain and SOB in the setting of alcohol withdrawal. Patient has
had multiple social stressors including loss his job 1 year ago,
recent loss of unemployment benefits, threat of eviction. For
the 3 days prior to admission, he has been having intermittent,
worsening dull chest pain that then became constant. The pain

COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had
no
angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary artery disease.
 The
LAD had a calcified, 70-80% lesion after D1.  The high first
diagonal
had diffuse disease a mid vessel total oclusion with
collaterals.  The
LCx had mild diffuse diease.  The RCA had a 60% proximal and
distal
lesions.
2.  Limited resting hemodyanamics revealed normal systemic blood

pressure, with a central aortic pressure of 131/86 mmHg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
.
ECHO ([**4-14**])
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2113-7-21**], the findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year-old man with a history of anxiety, alcohol
abuse, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, stage III CKD and HCV
admitted with chest pain in the setting of alcholol withdrawal
with signs and symptoms of [**Hospital 7792**] transferred to CCU for
worsened hypoxia and chest pain requiring nitro drip with
subsequent cardiac catheterization with placement of bare metal
stent to his proximal LAD.
.
# Coronaries: He had no known CAD but did have multiple risk
factors including HTN, HLD, current tobacco use, and significant
recent stress. He reported a history of chest pressure that
radiated to his left arm in addition to SOB. On arrival to he
the CCU he was experiencing chest pain that required a
nitroglycerin drip to keep him pain free. He had EKG changes in
an LAD distribution and cardiac biomarker elevations that were
consistent with NSTEMI. He had not had a catheterization in the
past because of his history of medication non-compliance,
therefore it was determined that if intervention was required
balloon angioplasty or bare metal stent would be preferable to
DES. On [**4-14**], he was taken to cardiac catheterization with
identification of proximal LAD disease with placement of
bare-metal stent to proximal LAD. He was continued on metoprolol
(uptitrated to 50mg QID), amlodipine, valsartan, atorvastatin 80
mg daily, aspirin 325 mg po daily, and plavix 75 mg po daily.
Due to coronary stent, pt should not receive electroconvlusive
therapy (ETC) as part of any depression treatment, for 30 days
post stent. At this point in time, pt is medically stable and
appropriate for transfer to a psychiatric floor.
.
#Pump: Patient has no known history of CHF. He appeared
euvolemic on exam. He did not require diuresis during CCU stay.
.
#Rhythm: His alcohol withdrawl placed him at increased risk for
arrhythmia. He remained in sinus rhythm throughout his
hospitalization.
.
#Hypertension: He has known hypertension as an outpatient. His
blood pressure was well controlled throughout his admission. He
was continued on his home dose of amlodipine and valsartan with
metoprolol uptitrated 50mg QID.
.
# Depression: He was very despondent on admission with
significant hopeless and anxiety. He has known severe depression
and will likely need inpatient psychiatric admission after
medical stabilization. Pyschiatry continued to follow patient
during admission and guided treatment of depression. He received
his home dose of quietpine, fluoxetine and trazodone. At time of
stabilization for cardiac issues pt was transfered to the
psychiatry service for further management of EtOH
withdrawal/depression as he was appropriate for transfer to a
psych floor in relation to his other medical issues. Due to
coronary stent, pt should not receive electroconvlusive therapy
(ETC) as part of any depression treatment, for 30 days post
stent.
.
# EtOH withdrawal: He has a history of DTs in the setting of
alcohol withdrawl. He did endorse tremors and visual
hallucinations on the day of admission and he was maintained on
a diazepam CIWA scale without further evidence of tremulousness.
He was maintaned on thiamine, folate, and daily multivitamin.
.
#CKD: He has known stage III CKD. His creatinine on admission
was 1.4, which is slightly better than prior baseline of
1.6-2.0. His renal status was carefully monitored and remained
stable. He received appropriate pre-cath and post-cath hydration
and Cr was stabile through admission.
.
#Anemia: He has a anemia at baseline with HCT in the high 30s.
This was appropriately montiored and and remained stable
throghout hospitalization.
.
# Hep C: His most recent viral load was very elevated and he has
no history of cirrhosis. His coags were normal and his LFTs were
WNL.
.
#Tobacco: He currently smokes tobacco typically [**2-27**] cigars
daily. He declined desire to use a nicotine patch while admitted
in the hospital.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known firstname 7710**] is a 45 year old female with history of alcoholism
s/p recent relapse who presents to ED after taking unknown
number of dilaudid tablets and drinking 2 bottles of wine at 2PM
today after a fight with her husband.  The patient had been
given a prescription for dilaudid after a fall three weeks ago
which resulted in 4 broken ribs on the left.  At that time she
was given a prescription for 360 2mg tablets of dilaudid.  She
reports taking 8-10 tablets daily over the past three weeks due
to rib pain.  Today she got into an argument with her husband
and felt that she ""wanted to sleep"" and therefore took
""handfuls"" of dilaudid.  She does acknowledge that she wanted to
hurt herself.  She was found by her husband who called EMS.
Upon arrival, EMS found 17 tablets remaining in the bottle.  She
denies taking any other medication or drugs.  She was given 1mg

overdose and was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**7-6**]
somnolent and on a Naloxone drip. She had no acute events
overnight The Naloxone drip was discontinued around 0600 on
[**7-7**]. The patient was awake and alert for morning rounds on
[**7-7**]. Although the patient denied symptoms of alcohol withdrawal
in the past, due to concern for alchol and benzo withdrawal, the
patient was written for a CIWA triggered diazepam dose during
the day on [**7-7**]; however, she never displayed signs of
withdrawal and thus had no need for diazepam. A psychiatry
consult was called in order to assess her need for 1:1 sitter as
well as her integrated plan for care concerning her depression,
recent suicide attempt, and substance abuse. She left the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
with no obvious lingering effects of Dilaudid overdose, no signs
of symptoms of alcohol withdrawal (note that patient was still <
48 since last alcholic beverage), and no acute medical issues.
Note that her home anxiolytics and her antihypertensives were
held while she resided in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

History of Present Illness:
This is a 50 year old male with history of hypertension,
osteomyelitis, chronic pain and depression who was brought in
from home after an attempted suicide by narcotic overdose. Per
patient's wife, she heard a thud in the other room and found the
patient ""jerking"" on the ground. EMS was called and found the
patient to be in cardiac arrest, administered epinephrine with
return of sinus rhythm (no shock given) and subsequently
intubated the patient for airway protection. Patient was found
with an empty bottle of dilaudid. Patient takes methadone and
dilaudid for chronic ankle pain. [**Name (NI) **] wife noted that he
had been very depressed and crying at times over the past few
months.
.
In the ED, vitals 101.8, 110, 75/20, 19, 99%. Toxicology screen
was positive for methadone/opiates and ETOH (level 88),
otherwise negative for aspirin and tylenol. Stat head CT was
negative for bleed or emboli. Chest x-ray showed no acute
infiltrate. EKG showed sinus tach with 1/2mm ST depressions in
V3-V4. Patient's initial lactate 27 and he was given 3 amps of
HCO3 with repeat lactate 10. Patient's initial ABG
6.65/91/348-bicarb 12. Repeat ABG
7.11/44/142/15.
.
Toxicology was consulted. Patient admitted to taking double his
usual methadone dose, but denied ASA, tylenol or other agents.
Toxicology did not fell that patient's presentation was
consistent with narcotic overdose as patient improved without
narcan.
.
Patient was started on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl. He
was bolused 4 liters normal saline. Three PIVs were placed and
Levophed was started peripherally. Patient's SBP increased to
SBO 100s and levaphed was weaned. Patient's levophed stopped
prior to transfer to the MICU.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST
FINDINGS: BRAIN MRI:
IMPRESSION: Signal abnormalities at both posterior frontal and
parietal convexity region on FLAIR and T2-weighted images
without corresponding enhancement or diffusion abnormalities.
These findings could be secondary to previous infarcts. No
enhancing lesions are seen. If the patient has prior MRI
examinations, comparison would be helpful. The appearances are
not typical for reversible encephalopathy. Small areas of
microhemorrhages are seen in both cerebral hemispheres near the
convexity indicating old hemorrhages. No enhancing lesions are
seen.
MRA OF THE HEAD: Normal MRA OF THE HEAD:
MRV OF THE HEAD: Normal MRV of the head.
.
DUPLEX LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US [**2-25**]:
1. Normal Doppler study.
2. Extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with mild intrahepatic
biliary ductal dilatation. An MRCP would be helpful in order to
assess for any obstructive process.
3. Marked wall thickening of the gallbladder with intramural
edema. This can be seen in several clinical scenarios, including
cholecystitis but other features of cholecystitis are not
present such as stones and distention. If however this diagnosis
is strongly suspected clinically a HIDA scan could be performed.
The appearance can be seen in acute hepatic disease and
hypoalbuminemia as well.
4. Possible edema around the head of the pancreas. Correlation
with pancreatitic enzymes to exclude coincident pancreatitis is
recommended.
.
EEG [**2-25**]:
BACKGROUND: Consisted of a 10 Hz posterior predominant rhythm
bilaterally. At times, faster beta rhythms were observed. This
may be
due to medications.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed as the patient could
not
comply.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be done as this was a

portable EEG.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness into drowsiness
but no
stage II sleep was seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rate and rhythm with
a rate
of approximately 70 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is a normal EEG in the awake and drowsy states.
No
focal or epileptiform features were observed.
.
ECHO [**2-25**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2135-5-4**], there is less tricuspid regurgitation,
pulmonary pressures are lower
.
MRI ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2136-2-26**]:
1. Underdistended gallbladder with no apparent stones.
Gallbladder wall edema/pericholecystic fluid is not a specific
finding. If clinical concern exists for chronic cholecystitis, a
HIDA scan would be the study of choice.
2. Prominent extrahepatic bile duct tapers normally and
demonstrates no evidence of choledocholithiasis.
3. Extensive subcutaneous edema.
4. Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions.
Of note, technical issues prevented complete normal study and no
gadolinium was administered.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2136-2-28**]: PA and lateral radiographs of the
chest are reviewed, and compared with the previous study of
[**2136-2-25**].
The patient has been extubated. The previously identified
congestive heart failure has been improving. There is continued
cardiomegaly and small right pleural effusion associated with
bilateral lower lobe patchy atelectasis.
Note is made of a question of nodular opacity in the right apex,
which can be composite shadow. When patient is better, evaluate
with repeated PA, bilateral shallow oblique radiographs of the
chest.
IMPRESSION:
1. Improving congestive heart failure with remaining
cardiomegaly and small right pleural effusion.
2. Question of nodular opacity in the right apex.
.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT  [**2136-2-29**]: DVT within one of the
distal right brachial veins as well as cephalic vein. Basilic
vein was not visualized. No evidence of hematoma within the
right upper neck.
.
C1894 INT.SHTH NOT/GUID,EP,NONLASER  [**2136-3-1**]: Successful
placement of a 14-French 20-cm double-lumen hemodialysis
catheter by way of the left internal jugular vein with tip in
the superior vena cava. The catheter can be used immediately.
.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT  [**2136-3-2**]: No evidence of DVT in
the right lower extremity.
.
[**Numeric Identifier 7670**] FLUORO 1 HR W/RADIOLOGIST  [**2136-3-8**]: Successful conversion
from a temporary left internal jugular to a tunneled
hemodialysis catheter (27 cm from cuff to tip). The catheter is
ready for immediate use.

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is a 50 year old man with history of hypertension,
depression, chronic pain and osteomyelitis who presented with
likely cardiac arrest secondary to opioid overdose and possible
associated seizure. On admission to the emergency department,
patient was only briefly hypotensive with systolic in 70's which
responded to IV fluid resuscitation and required transient
peripheral levophed. Patient was also empirically started on
broad spectrum antibiotics and given PO charcoal. A LP was
performed to rule out meningitis in setting of witnessed
seizure. Also, of note, patient was in severe lactic acidosis
with pH <7.0 which responded to stat administration of 3 amps of
sodium bicarbonate. Patient's mental status improved after ED
resuscitation and he was transferred to the MICU for further
care.
.
In the MICU, patient subsequently developed elevated LFTs,
rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. Patient remained
intubated for airway protection. Initially, patient had a severe
anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory
acidosis. Metabolic acidosis was likely secondary to lactic
acidosis in setting of cardiac arrest decreased organ perfusion
and possible seizure. Etiology of non-gap acidosis was unclear.
Patient's mental status and respiratory acidosis improved and he
was extubated on [**2-26**] after a RSBI ~10. Patient sating 94% on 5L
nasal cannula after extubation. Repeat CXR was improved but
continued to show pulmonary edema. Patient remained stable and
was subsequently transferred to the floor.
.
#. ?Seizure: Patient was initially worked up for seizure with a
differential diagnosis of opiate overdose, vasovagal induced,
infection induced or EtOH withdrawal induced. MRI/MRA/MRV were
negative for emboli or other abnormalities. Repeat ECHO this
admission largely unchanged from prior if not improved. LP was
performed and not consistent with meningitis. Patient with
positive tox screen for alcohol and opiates. Patient admitted to
drinking cough syrup at home. He and his wife had quit drinking
alcohol approximately 1 month ago. Patient was placed on CIWA
scale while on the floor. Unclear whether patient actually
seized or had post cardiac arrest movements however if patient
did seize the likely etiology was either alcohol withdrawal or
opiate overdose induced metabolic derangement. Patient's mental
status returned to baseline and no recurrence of seizures
occurred while in hospital. EEG was negative for seizure.
Nonspecific vascular findings on MRI, per neurology were old and
would not have contributed to current presentation. Plan is to
have patient follow-up with a repeat MRI and see neurology as an
outpatient in [**6-21**] weeks time.
.
#. Rhabdomyolysis: Etiology likely secondary to immobilization
and ischemic compression of muscle induced by opioid overdose
versus drug induced seizures or hyperthermia associated with
excess muscle energy demands. Also, metabolic derangement
including hypokalemia (2.8 on admission) and hypocalcemia (5.9)
may have contributed or caused the rhabdo but unclear etiology
of electrolyte abnormalities ?opioid overdose. CPK peaked at
150,000 on [**2-25**] and then continued to downtrend. Calcium was
repleted aggressively while alkalinizing his urine to prevent
further renal damage.
.
#. ARF: On admission, Cr 1.0 increaed to 4.8 on [**2-26**] and
continued to increase to peak of 10.3 on [**3-1**]. Etiology of acute
renal failure likely secondary to hypovolemia during cardiac
arrest and rhabdomyolysis. Patient was intially aggressively
hydrated and his urine was alkalinized with HCO3 to avoid
further renal damage from myoglobin. He was also given mannitol
to osmotically diurese which was eventually held on [**2-26**]. There
was an unsuccessful RIJ line placement on [**2-29**], no hematoma was
seen on neck US. IR placed temporary dialysis catheter in LIJ on
[**3-1**] and then switched over a tunnelled cath into LIJ on [**3-8**].
Patient initally required daily dialysis and then three times a
week. At time of discharge, patient had gone for 5 days without
dialysis and was making large volumes of urine. Electrolytes
were followed carefully and phosphate binders were used as
needed. He will need to have his electrolytes (Chem 7, calcium,
magnesium, phosphate) checked in 48 hours, 1 week, and two weeks
to ensure recovery of kidney function. He will need removal of
his tunneled hemodialysis catheter in two days, on [**2136-3-14**], to be done by interventional radiology. A renal consult
should be obtained for follow up of chemistries. The renal
consult service will decide when patient will be able to have
his tunneled catheter removed by interventional radiology.
.
#. Chronic pain/R LE pain: Patient with history of right ankle
injury requiring multiple surgeries between [**2126**]-[**2130**]. It was
recommended in [**2130**] that he have his R ankle amputated however
patient decided not to have the amputation and to medically
treat his chronic pain. Had been on methadone and dilaudid PO as
an outpatient. Pain medications were held until patient's mental
status was at baseline and then he was started and gradually
titrated up on a fentanyl patch with oxycodone PRN for
breakthrough. IV diladudid was used as breakthrough which was
subsequently switched to PO dilaudid and then discontinued due
to adequate pain control. Please obtain pain management consult
for pain control if pain is unable to be controlled with
fentanyl patch with oxycodone.
.
#. Depression: Patient now at baseline mental status however
severely depressed. Psychiatry was consulted regarding the
opiate overdose and felt that patient required inpatient
admission for suicide attempt. Continued to hold Zoloft.
Continued 1:1 sitter. As patient was medically stable, he was
transferred to an inpatient psychiatry floor for further care.
.
#. Anemia: Unclear etiology. Hct baseline 29.0. Paitnet received
2 units in hemodialysis on [**3-5**]. Hct remained stable thereafter.
Guaiaced all stools which have been negative.
.
#. R UE brachial DVT: Patient received anti-coagulation for 1
week with IV heparin and then for a short period of time on
coumadin. Review of US with radiology showed distal location of
possible clot and low risk for embolization and so no further
anti-coagulation was planned. Decision not to anticoagulate was
approved by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Patient will not need to have heparin SC
injections for DVT prophylaxis if he continues to ambulate.
.
#. Increased LFTs: most likely secondary to acidemia, possibly
shock liver. Initially, RUQ US suggestive for cholecystitis
however subsequent abdominal MRI showed prominent extrahepatic
bile duct tapers normally and demonstrates no evidence of
choledocholithiasis. Liver was consulted and recommended the
following tests: VZV IgG negative, CMV negative, ceruloplasmin
wnl, Hep A, B, C negative, [**Doctor First Name **] and anti-smooth Ab negative, IgG
low, HSV1 IgG-, HSV2 IgG-, EBV IgG+ IgM-. Alkaline phosphatase
and total bilirubin began to downtrend without intervention and
so no HIDA/MRCP was pursued. Near resolution of elevated LFTs at
time of discharge.
.
#. ID: Patient with very high temp in ED. Differential diagnosis
included seizure versus infectious etiology. Patient was
pan-cultured in ED with no growth. Patient was only briefly
hypotensive and on transient levophed. Patient initially
empirically covered with vanco, levo and flagyl. LP negative for
organisms and not consistent with meningitis. On [**2-26**],
antibiotics were discontinued given low suspicion for infection.
.
#. HTN: Continued to hold BP agents and follow SBP closely.
.
#. Obstructive sleep apnea: Unclear whether patient suffers from
this but he can schedule a sleep study as outpatient.
.
#. Abnormal chest x-ray findings: Patient will need to follow-up
with chest x-ray with PA/LAT/bilateral shallow oblique views to
re-evaluated possible nodular opacity in right apex of lung seen
on chest x-ray [**2136-2-28**]. However this admission, no definite

control; transitioned back to po labetalol once BP was
reasonably well controlled. Pt refused additional
antihypertensives, saying, ""You new doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] in here and
think you can make my blood pressure perfect, but I have high
blood pressure all the time and always have.""

- According to renal (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7143**], who follows pt), she insists
that no volume be removed at HD, saying that when volume is
removed, she feels ""terrible."" As a result, her volume status
complicates her blood pressure management
- After patient was informed that she would have to wait until
4pm for hemodialysis, she left against medical advice.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit and patient was managed with Haldol 2 mg
intravenously q. 30 minutes to achieve calmness.  Patient was
also given benzodiazepines.  The patient remained agitated
and confused in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  Patient
was placed on monitoring to measure QTC prolongation as well
as numerous 12 lead electrocardiograms which revealed no
problems with rhythm abnormalities.  Patient was also sent to
have a head CT.  Patient could not undergo the procedure
since she was quite agitated even after being given versed
and Haldol.  Patient was seen by Psychiatry in the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit who suggested only to continue the
patient on Haldol with no further benzodiazepine
administration since this may have worsened her delirium.

Patient was transferred to Five South on the second day after
admission.  The patient's mental status on the first day on
the floor remained agitated and confused.  Patient had a 1:1
sitter.  Patient did undergo a CT scan on the second day of
admission which revealed no intra or extracranial hemorrhage.
The CT scan also revealed no edema or infarction.  Patient's
mental status continued to improve greatly.  By the second
day of admission, patient became far less agitated.  Haldol 2
mg q. 30 minutes was not needed.  The patient was given only
Haldol on only two or three occasions.  By the third day of
admission, patient's mentation appeared excellent and at near
baseline.  Patient continued to have no QT segment changes on
telemetry on the floors.  Electrocardiograms q.d. also
revealed no rhythm abnormalities.  Patient's pain was
controlled with Toradol intravenously, as well as Darvocet
100 mg tablets every four hours, which patient states that
she took at home.  The patient was also seen by the Cast
Service who re-fitted her for a lower back brace cast which
patient states decreased her pain as well.  Psychiatry saw
the patient once again and decided that the patient did not
need a 1:1 sitter and was safe for discharge.  Patient stated
at this time with clear mentation that there was absolutely
no suicide attempt.  Patient states that she had been
self-medicating in order to help relieve her symptoms of the
pneumonia.  She states no suicidal ideation or plan.  Patient

History of Present Illness:
23 year old woman with ESRD, SLE, recently placed PD catheter
who presents with periorbital swelling and Hypertensive urgency.
Of note she was recently admitted for tongue swelling on
[**4-7**]. At that time she was treated with Solu-Medrol,
famotidine and Benadryl in the emergency room, which was
continued for a total of three doses on the floor. The swelling
improved throughout her stay. She had been on both an ACE, [**Last Name (un) **]
and DRI at home, which she has been taking for many years.
Patient states that the tongue swelling is most likely due to a
sardine allergy. However, she had recently added Dilaudid to her
medications following PD catheter placement, so allergy to
Dilaudid was also considered. The ACE, [**Last Name (un) **] and DRI were held on
the day of admission for ?angioedema but restarted on day of
discharge without incident so she was discharged on them.

She returned to the ED [**5-24**] with acute onset bilateral eye
swelling since night of [**5-23**]. VS T 97.9 HR 78 BP 231/120 RR 20
Sat 100% RA. She was given IV solumedrol 125iv, benadryl IV, and
pepcid. Her BP was noted to be 240's despite labetolol 900mg po,
then labetolol 20mg iv x2 so was started on labetolol gtt:
highest dose 2mg/min. This was stopped after 35 minutes, in
favor of nitro gtt. States compliant with meds at home.

Patient was comfortable on admission to the MICU. Notes pain in
abdomen 7.5/10 related to PD catheter placement (has had since
then), improves with morphine. Also notes swelling in eyes/face
since last night (has had in the past but never this severe,
always goes away on its own). She feels whole body is swollen
slightly but no more upper extremities than lower. She denies
visual changes, HA, change in hearing/tinitus, congestion, sore
throat, cough, SOB, chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomitting,
diarrhea. Has baseline constipation (takes stool softener), last
BM 2 days ago (normal), no melena, brbpr, diarrhea. No dysuria,
hematuria, change in uop, increase weight or size (clothes fit
the same), tingling, numbness, weakness, discoordination, rash,
joint pain, recent travel, ill contacts, exotic foods. She notes
episode of throat swelling over weekend resolved, seemed to be
related to sardine eating (not new for her).

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 23yo woman with a history of SLE, ESRD and HTN
who presented with acute onset bilateral facial swelling and
hypertensive urgency, which developed into L sided facial, L arm
and L breast swelling throughout her stay.

# L facial/arm and breast swelling: Initially this presented
only as facial swellingand ACE and [**Last Name (un) **] were held for possible
angioedema, however holding medications nad giving benadryl
failed to relieve symptoms.  We then suspected possible venous
thrombus with occlusion leading to edema. US of upper left
extremity failed to show evidence of acute occlusion, but showed
R IJ occlusion consistent with prior studies. MRA could not
visualize the L brachiocephalic vein. Repeat MRV suggested
chronic occlusion of the L brachiocephalic vein. Venogram
performed on [**5-31**] showed extensive collateralization of the L
brachiocephalic vein with patent flow through these collaterals.
Intervention on the L brachiocephalic vein was attempted by IR,
but was unsuccessful. The primary team, renal team, [**Month/Year (2) **]
team and hematology team suspect that the most likely etiology
of her swelling is an acute-on-chronic (now occlusive) thrombus
of the L brachiocephalic vein.  For this reason, the patient was
placed on Heparin IV as a bridge to coumadin anticoagulation
with goal INR [**2-12**]. Per consult with hematology the patient is to
remain on this regimen for at least 6 months, and will then
revisit as an outpatient the question of possible lifelong
anticoagulation. The patient has had extensive negative testing
for hypercoagulable states, including during this work-up with
negative anticardiolipin, antiphospholipid, Beta-2 glycoprotein
and AT3 antibodies. Protein C and S levels were unremarkable.
Although her clots seem to have all occured in the setting of
lines, her continued thrombosis is likey due to
hypercoagulability from her lupus (in absence of lupus
anticoagulant). Her INR will be followed first by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4883**],
her nephrologist, and then by the coumadin clinic of [**Company 191**]. It
will be especially important that her coumadin be well titrated
given her risk of intracranial bleed with hypertension. This was
communicated tothe patient and she understands and plans to be
compliant with frequent blood draws for INR testing and varying
her coumadin dose as directed.
.
# Hypertension: The patient has chronically labile hypertension,
with frequent episodes of hypertensive urgency over systolic
200, as well as lows as far as the 80s during this admission. It
remains unclear why her blood pressure is so chronically labile.
The hope is that once she starts dialysis this will help to
stabilize her blood pressure, however in the interim various
adjustments were made to her regimen.  The patient received
frequent extra doses during her stay (especially of
hydralazine), however, this occasionally causes her blood
pressure to swing too low to tolerate her subsequent standing
dose of medication.  We stopped her Ace and  [**Last Name (un) **] as above. We
discharged her to home on a regimen that was reviewed with her
nephrologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4883**].  She is discharged on clonidine
patch 0.3mg qweek, labetalol 900mg po tid, nifedipine CR 90mg po
bid, hydralazine 35mg po tid. These medications were reviewed
extensively with the patient and she was given prescriptions for
all meds. She is discharged with home VNA for blood pressure
checks and assistance with meds. She has purchased a portable BP
cuff and will keep a BP diary to bring to subsequent
appointments as well. The importance of BP control, especially
in the setting of new anticoagulation, was discussed extensively
with the patient. Her goal SBP is 140-160 at this time.
.
# ESRD: The patient has ESRD due to lupus nephritis. PD catheter
was placed before admission and the patient received morphine
prn pain at her catheter site. The renal team followed her
closely throughout her stay. She was treated for hypocalcemia as
well as hyperkalemia.  Her regimen was changed to calcitriol
0.25mcg po qday, sodium bicarb 1300mg po qday, cholecalciferol
400units po qday, ergocalciferol 50,000 units po qweek for ten
weeks. She plans to start HD within 1-2 weeks of discharge. She
will call [**Doctor First Name 3040**] the PD nurse tomorrow to set up an appointment
to have her catheter flushed and to start PD. She will be
closely followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4883**] at PD.

# SLE: The patient was maintained on her home dose of prednisone
15mg po qday throughout her stay. She has no symptoms of acute
SLE flare, so her nephrologist and outpatient physicians may
attempt to wean this down as an outpatient.
.
# abnormal pap smear: The pt is noted to have an abnormal pap
and colpo two years ago with CIN 2 and high risk HPV. This has
never been repeated, as the patient failed to schedule
appointments and DNK others.  We discussed the importance of
following this up with the patient, and at her request scheduled
her for an ob/gyn appointment as an outpatient shortly after
discharge.

The patient was discharged to home with a clear plan to call
[**Doctor First Name 3040**], the PD nurse on the day after discharge to set up an
appointment to have her PD catheter flushed later this week, as
well as to set a date to start her PD.  She will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 44539**]
in [**Hospital **] clinic within the next 1-2 weeks. She will have her blood
drawn for INR in two days and faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4883**],
subsequently this will be faxed to the [**Company 191**] coumadin clinic and
her dose will be adjusted for INR [**2-12**]. We have also given her
the phone number to call [**Company 191**] and establish care with a new PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] her old PCP has now graduated and her complex management
makes a PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 44540**]. (Her PCP must be at [**Company 191**] for the [**Company 191**]
coumadin clinic to follow her as well.) Finally, the patient was
given an appointment with ob/gyn to have a follow up pap smear,
as her last pap and colpo two years ago showed CIN 2 with high
risk HPV and this has not been followed.

The above plan and appoitnments were reviewed with the pt and
her mother extensively. [**Name2 (NI) **] medication hcanges were also
extensively reviewed.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted and treated for an acute exacerbation of a
chronic left brachiocephalic vein occlusion (a chronically
obstructed large vein closed off entirely) and hypertensive
urgency (very high blood pressure). We attempted to remove the
clot in your left brachiocephalic vein, but were unable to do
so. You have been started on long-term Coumadin (also called
warfarin) therapy to prevent future blood clots and to allow
natural dissolution of your current blood clot.

History of Present Illness:
67-yo morbidly obese woman transferred from [**Hospital3 **] w/
hypotension and atrial fib.  Last night, she took 10 percocet
tablets for acute on chronic low back pain.  This AM, she was
discovered by her son to be lethargic and unresponsive.  He
called EMS, who administered Narcan in the field resulting in
rapid improvement in the pt's mental status.  Upon arrival to
[**Hospital3 **] ED, she was in atrial fibrillation w/ HR 120s,
BP 104/70, groggy but responsive.  EKG showed ST changes thought
to be ST elevations in V1-V2.  She was treated w/ ASA 324 mg,
heparin gtt, and diltiazem 30 mg IV followed by 5 mg/hr gtt,
resulting in BP decrease to 66/40 and HR decrease to 80s.  She
was then treated w/ phenylephrine gtt for BP support through a
peripheral IV.  She is now transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for
ongoing care.
.
Currently, she is on phenylephrine, diltiazem, and heparin gtt.
She denies any recent chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea,
presyncope, or syncope.  Further history is unavailable at
present due to pt's lethargy.

.
[**4-15**] CT Angio Chest:
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There are no filling defects in the
pulmonary arterial vasculature. Small peripheral lung nodule (2,
24) measuring 3 mm is seen in the right upper lobe. A second
larger nodule measuring 4.5 mm (2, 23 is also seen in the right
upper lobe. There are coronary artery calcifications present.
Smooth interlobular septal thickening with areas of ground-glass
opacity are seen throughout both lung fields with tiny bilateral
pleural effusions, right greater than left and associated
atelectasis at the lung bases. Findings are consistent with
fluid overload. Few images through the upper abdomen are normal.
The airways are patent at the level of the segmental bronchi
bilaterally. No enlarged axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph
nodes are present. Small hilar lymph nodes on the right measure
8 mm (2,22).
IMPRESSION: 1) No lung mass seen. Small pulmonary nodules as
described above. If there is a history of smoking or other risk
factors, a follow up chest CT in 12 months is recommended to
document stability.

function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall
hypokinesis c/w primary pulmonary process (COPD, pulmonary
embolism, etc.). Preserved global left ventricular systolic
function.


Brief Hospital Course:
67-yo-woman w/ DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia, COPD, low back pain
transferred from OSH w/ lethargy, hypotension, and atrial
fibrillation after percocet overdose.  Hospital course by
problem:
.
#) Hypotension: Etiology likely iatrogenic from diltiazem w/
contribution from opioid overdose. There were no signs of
infection; no reason to suspect adrenal insufficiency or
significant volume depletion. Was briefly on neosynephrine but
this was quickly weaned.  We restarted losartan and beta blocker
and she was normotensive for >24 hours prior to discharge.
.
#) Atrial fibrillation: Initially, this appeared to be a new dx
of atrial fib. Possible causes in this case include COPD,
cardiac ischemia, hypoxia, and thyroid disease. We rate
controlled first with dilt then metoprolol (given slight
troponin leak).  She spontaneously converted to NSR on [**4-14**].  We
treated first with heparin gtt.  On further questioning, patient
reports that she may have been told that she had an irregular
heartbeat in the past.  Given this possible recurrence of Afib,
we recommend treatment with coumadin.  We discharged the patient
on coumadin in addition to her BB and ask that she have an INR
check two days following discharge.  She had direct instructions
from us to go to her PCP's office for a lab draw.
- We have set her up to see a cardiologist in [**Hospital1 **] as
mentioned below.  We will provide his office with this summary.
.
#) Cards ischemic: patient had slight enzyme leak as above.
This was likely in the setting of a tachycardia and her enzymes
were trending downward prior to discharge.  We performed an echo
which showed RV free wall hypokinesis and RA pressures which
were 16-20mm Hg.  There was no regional wall motion abnl of the
left ventricle.  We discharged patient on BB with close
followup.
- also started ASA prior to discharge
.
#) respiratory: patient was able to tolerate room air.  However,
given the above mentioned findings on echo, we performed a V/Q
scan to assess for PE.  There was no evidence of a PE.
- patient with likely sleep apnea given body habitus.  We would
recommend a sleep study within the near future.
.
#) Pulmonary nodules: The V/Q scan demonstarted a possible
mediastinal mass which prompted the above mentioned CT scan.  It
did not confirm such a mass.  However, pulm nodules were noted
as above.  We recommend a followup CT scan in 12 months as per
the radiologists recommendation to assess for interval change.
.
#) Percocet overdose: this is likely the cause of her somnolence
and resp depression by history; utox was positive for opioids.
This was seemingly an unintentional overdose.  Patient however
had a flat affect and we consulted with the social
worker/addiction counselor.  They recommend the following:
-Suggest psycho pharm consult as outpatient
We also recommend close followup with the PCP to monitor for any
signs or symptoms of depression.  Prior to discharge, the
patient reported that it was not a suicide attempt and she did
not have any SI or HI.
.
#) Cellulitis: RLE was erythematous and slightly tender,
possible due to venous stasis changes. Leukocytosis but afebrile
and changes chronic; thus decided not to treat for cellulitis.
.
#) DM type 2: controlled w/ diet as outpt.
- follow FS QID
- cover w/ RISS
.
#) Kidney disease: she had creat 1.3 w/ unknown baseline.  this
improved to 0.7 prior to discharge.
.
#) COPD: unknown severity.
- albuterol INH prn for wheezing
.
#) HTN: controlled w/ losaratan as outpt;  Also added on BB as
above.
.
#) Hyperlipidemia: controlled w/ simvastatin; we continued.
.
#) GERD: controlled w/ PPI; we continued.
.
#) Full code
.
#) Dispo status: fair understanding of the events leading up to
hospitalization as well as discharge instructions.  She will f/u
with PCP in two days for an INR check.  We will also contact PCP
to discuss hospital course.

Chief Complaint:
Mental status change

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
46yo gentleman with history of Crohn's on prednisone, type 2 DM
on insulin, depression with h/o suicidal gestures, and CAD s/p
DES to LAD who presented with altered mental status.

Over the last two days, he has been markedly thirsty, and has
started drinking large amounts of milk or chocolate milk.  He is
not sure if he took his dose of lantus the night before
admission and admits to skipping sugar checks during the day.
+Polyuria.  +Cough productive of yellow sputum x 1 week.
+Nausea but no vomiting.  He has been having 2 BMs per day,
which is much better than is normal for his Crohn's.

He walked a block to CVS in order to buy cigarettes and fill his
prescriptions.  He was walking over to smoke his cigarette when
he noticed he was feeling unsteady.  He leaned against a tree
and then slumped down to the ground.  A bystander came to his
aid and EMS was called.

In the ED, initial VS were 100.2 (Tmax 102.2)   174/100   140
18   96%.  He denied CP or SOB.  He was profusely diaphoretic.
Neurologic exam was nonfocal but he had increased muscle tone.
He was empirically treated with stress dose hydrocortisone and
valium.  Somewhat later, he became increasingly somnolent.  He
received narcan, and just as the team was about to intubate him,
he sat up on the table and was entirely awake.  He had a VBG,
which was 7.33/49/60 with a lactate of 4.7.  EKG did not show
acute ischemia, and intervals were normal.  Head CT was negative
and CXR showed what was thought to be LLL pneumonia, so he was
given vancomycin and levofloxacin.  Just prior to transfer to
the ICU, he was given 10 units of IV insulin for BS 373.  He
received 2.5 L IVF in ED.

Upon arrival to the ICU, he wanted to have a bowel movement and
he asked immediately for some water to drink.  He specifically
denied taking any extra or new medications.  He states his mood
has been good lately and that he is not suicidal: ""I would not
walk in front of a bus, but if a bus came and hit me, that would
be okay.""

Brief Hospital Course:
# Altered Mental Status:  DDx at admission hyperosmolar
hyperglycemic state (though not hyperosmolar at admission), drug
overdose (TCA level high at admission), suicide attempt, sepsis,
serotonin syndrome, or seizure.  Patient's home medications of
Prednisone and metoprolol could also contribute.  Most likely
developed pneumonia, which caused hyperglycemia.  He then
developed marked dehydration, which led to his presentation.
Pt. had a recent w/u for questionable seizure at OSH.  Patient
was given 3L NS in the ICU.  Sedating medications (fentanyl,
temazepam, tizanidine) were held.  Treatment was started for CAP
with levofloxacin (day 1 = [**11-9**]) for planned 5 day course.  He
was treated with tamiflu X 2 days until Influenza swab was
negative. Urine legionella antigen was negative, as was a NCHCT.
His respiratory status and mental status remained stable during
this admission and he was discharged home.

# Hyperglycemia and Type 2 DM: Patient was put on a sliding
scale with home glargine (decreased dose 12/9 am as patient not
taking good PO).  Serum electrolytes in the ICU were checked and
repleted twice daily. He continued to have difficult to control
blood surgars during this hospitalization. Insulin was
increased. Morning blood glucose was in the 100s, but by noon
glucose was often as high as 400, but with no gap. Patient was
seen by nurses exhibiting nonadherence to recommended diet,
often with overconsumption of diabetic products.

# Suspected Community Acquired PNA:   Started on levofloxacin x
5 days (day 1 = [**11-9**]).

# Acute Respiratory Acidosis: Likely due to hypoventilation in
setting of altered mental status.  Anion gap at admission 14
with a lactate of 4.7, suggesting he may have had a concurrent
anion gap acidosis, however lactate decreased day after
admission and MS improved.

# Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia: Likely has pseudohyponatremia;
elevated K+ is likely due to transcellular shifts as it
resolved.

# Leukocytosis: Likely due to pneumonia or stress reaction.  No
bands.

# CAD s/p NSTEMI with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2 to LAD in [**2154**]: Continued plavix,
beta blocker, and statin.  Pt. has ASA allergy.  CEs were
negative.

# h/o Crohn's disease:  Patient was continued on Prednisone and
home medications.  His fentanyl patched was restarted on [**11-10**]
due to improved MS.

# h/o major depression:  Continued lamictal, held nortriptyline
and lexapro, and temazepam at admission for AMS.  Contact[**Name (NI) **]
psychiatrist and....

# ADHD:  no need for methylphenidate in house

# h/o polysubstance abuse:  tox screen negative with exception
of elevated TCA

# HTN:  continued beta blocker

# Hypoandrogenism:  restart androgel as outpatient


#Diaphoresis: Patient often found diaphoretic and tremulous,
which he said is is baseline and necesitates carrying around
extra shirt. Unclear if this was low-grade withdrawal vs.
autonomic dysfunction. This has been a longstanding issue.

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 24 year old woman with a history of CKD V (on HD)
from lupus nephritis, chronic intermittent abdominal pain, and
multiple prior ICU admissions for hypertensive urgency who
presented to the ED complaining of two days' of abdominal pain,
nausea, and loose stools. She was feeling well until after her
hemodialysis session on Wednesday. Thereafter, she complained of
nausea with occasional vomitting and has been unable to keep
down any of her oral medications. She also has had diffuse
abdominal pain consistent with her prior flares of pain as well
as her typical diffuse headache. The headache in particular was
worsening and, for her, this is a sign of poorly-controlled
hypertension so she came to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Upon arrival to the
ED, she was afebrile, BP 240/184, HR 109, RR 16, Sat 99% on room
air. She was given 4 mg of IV ondansetron, [**1-11**] inch intropaste,
1 mg of IV hydromorphone x3, 1000cc of NS, and was put on a
labetalol drip which had to be increased up to 2 mg/min. A head
CT showed no acute abnormality (including hemorrhage) and an
abdominal CT showed some possible mild colitis, though it is
unclear if this is due to her recent peritoneal dialysis.

Past Medical History:
1. Systemic lupus erythematosus:
- Diagnosed [**2134**] (16 years old) when she had swollen fingers,
arm rash and arthralgias
- Previous treatment with cytoxan, cellcept; currently on
prednisone
- Complicated by uveitis ([**2139**]) and ESRD ([**2135**])
2. CKD/ESRD:
- Diagosed [**2135**]
- Initiated dialysis [**2137**] but refused it as of [**2140**], has
survived despite this
- PD catheter placement [**5-18**]
3. Malignant hypertension
- Baseline BPs 180's - 120's
- History of hypertensive crisis with seizures

urgency.

MICU course:
Current plan on transfer
24 year old woman with CKD V and severe hypertension due to SLE
admitted with flare of chronic abdominal pain and hypertensive
urgency.

1. Hypertensive urgency:
The patient was initially maintained on a labetalol drip and
hydralazine iv prn until oral anti-hypertensives lowered her
blood pressure. Initially her blood pressure over-corrected to
SBPs in the 80s (patient was asymptomatic). Her clonidine patch
and hydralazine was held and she again became hypertensive with
SBPs 190s.  The patient was restarted on a low dose clonidine
0.1 mg/24 hr patch, and hydralazine. The following dialysis the
patient asymptomatic with SBPs in 80s, MAPs 60s asymptomatic
again. Her hydralazine was stopped and continued on all her
other home medications at the advice of renal.  The patient was
transferred to the floor on [**12-10**] after resolution of her
hypertensive urgency with a decreased blood pressure regimen due
to her hypotension in response to home doses of her medications.
 On [**12-11**] the patient's SBP dropped to the 80's and due to her
pain medications she was extremely lethargic, but arousable.  A
PICC line was placed because lack of access and she was bolused
250cc NS. The patient's pressures responded and additional
narcotics were held due to her mental status.  The patient's
blood pressures continued to be labile and her clonidine patch
was increased to 0.3mg/24hr and her hydralazine was titrated
back to 100mg daily.  The patient did require IV hydralazine prn
for control of her blood pressures initially, but was stablized
back on her home regimen.  A possible component to the patient's
malignant hypertension is likely due to OSA.  An inpatient sleep
study was performed overnight on [**12-13**] and the patient was sent
home on BiPAP for OSA.  The patient was continuned on her
admission hypertensive regimen.
.
2. Abdominal pain: The etiology of her abdominal pain is
unclear, but has been a chronic issue for her. A CT scan was
performed that showed bowel wall changes that are likely
secondary to recent peritoneal dialysis and unrelated to pain.
The patient also had diarrhea, but stool studies were negative.
The patient's pain was initially treated with hydromorphone, but
because of the patient's lethargy on [**12-11**] they were initially
held.  She continued to complain of severe abdominal pain.  She
was slowly restarted back on her home regimen was 4mg po
hydromorphone q6 as her mental status improved.  Surgery was
consulted in regards to removal of her PD catheter, but given
that she may return to PD it was deferred to the outpatient
setting.

3. CKD V from lupus nephritis:  The patient was continued on HD
during her admission.  She was also continued on her home
prednisone dose.  She was closely followed by the renal team.
.
4. History of SVC/subclavian vein thrombus: The patient was
found to have a subtherapeutic INR on admission 1.3.  She was
started on a heparin gtt and continued on coumadin.  The
patient's heparin gtt was hled on [**12-10**] because of access
issues, but was restarted on [**12-11**] after her PICC line was
placed.  She was therapetuic the same day and her heparin gtt
was stopped.  On discharge her coumadin was supratherapeutic
(4.7) and was held.  She will have her INR checked at HD.
.
5. Anemia: The patient's Hct slowly trended down.  She was
guaiac negative and hemolysis labs were negative.  She was
transfused 1U pRBC at HD on [**12-12**].  She was also given epo at HD.

History of Present Illness:
51 y/o F w/COPD (FEV1 31%, multiple intubations in past), Hep C,
hx IVDA, who presented to the ED tonight with SOB x several
days.  On [**2184-3-13**], she called her [**Date Range 19039**] c/o sinus
congestion and rhinorrhea and was told she likely had a viral
URI.  This improved with symptomatic treatment with Advil Cold &
Sinus.  She called back on [**2184-3-22**] with a persistent cough and
increased sputum production (yellow).  At that point she was
given a z-pack and a one-week course of prednisone (40 mg
daily).  She finished the prednisone yesterday.  Since then, she
has had continued productive cough and worsening SOB.  Of note,
her nebulizer prescription was changed from four times per day
to once daily, so she has not been using her nebs as often.
*
In the ED, she was initially saturating 86% on RA.  After an
albuterol nebulizer, she improved to 94%.  She was also given
prednisone 60 mg and azithromycin.  She was admitted to medicine
for further management.


Past Medical History:
1. COPD, followed in Pulmonary by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Most recent
spirometry [**11-11**] revealed FEV1 of 1.13 (45% pred), FVC 2.58 (79%
pred), and FEV1/FVC ratio of 0.44.  Improved from prior in [**4-11**].
 Full PFTs from [**10-12**] also showed diffusion capacity 45% pred.
Exercise oximetry showed O2 sat 88%RA at rest, which decreased
to 80% w/ambulation.  ABG at that time 7.34/56/52 on RA.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 51 y/o F w/hx COPD who presents with increased sputum
production and SOB, c/w her usual COPD exacerbations.
*
##  COPD exacerbation:  This was likely triggered by a viral URI
and in the setting of under-using her nebulizer. She was started
on prednisone 60 mg daily with plans to use a longer taper as
she got worse so quickly after stopping the last time.
Azithromycin was continued for a five-day course. Neb treatments
were given prn. She remained stable on room air and intermittent
1L O2 with goal O2 sats 88-92%. She was able to maintain these
levels most of the time, with some desaturation to 85% on
ambulation. On [**4-5**] patient became somnolent and combative
repeat ABG showed increased CO2 retention.  Patient was
subsequently transferred to MICU for closer observation.
Patient was started on CPAP @ night with great improvement in
her mental status.  Patient did not require other antibiotics as
her WBC remained normal while on steroids and she was never
febrile with clear CXR.  Patient slowly improved and was
maintaining sats >91-92% with ambulation upon discharge.
Patient is to continue using her BIPAP @ [**9-10**] @ home.  She is to
continue her prednisone taper and will follow up with her
[**Month/Day (4) 19039**]
*
## Confusion - patient became suddenly somnolent on [**4-5**].  The
sudden onset of her symptoms was concerning for overmedication
however patient had not received anything for 8 hours prior
except Tylenol.  UTox and serum tox were negative.  ABG showed
increasing CO2 retention.  Patient was very angry when asked
about potential drug abuse and she was upset that this
assumption recurs as patient often mistaken her hypercarbia for
intoxication.  Her mental status quickly improved with
initiation of BIPAP @ night with improvement in her CO2 levels.
.
## MR - patient was found to have 2+ MR.  The etiology of her MR
remains unclear as she had no evidence of overwhelming LVH and
no evidence of ischemia.  Patient was counseled to take
antibiotic prophylaxis when undergoing dental work or other
invasive procedures.
.
## urinary frequency: She reports increasing urinary frequency
and also symptoms that may be consistent with an element of
urinary retention. She was on a medication prescribed by her PCP
~8 months ago that may have been Detrol. Her UA was
unremarkable, and her UCx grew <10,000 organisms.
*
## Hep C:  Genotype 2, stage I fibrosis on biopsy.  No
interferon per hepatology [**3-11**] pulmonary disease.
*
## IVDA: She was continued on her methadone maintenance.  She
reports she has had her dose increased from 60 mg to 70 mg
recently; however, no records in the OMR confirm this so she was
continued on 60mg.
*
## Seizure d/o: Keppra was continued.

Patient will follow up with her [**Month/Day (2) 19039**].

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
This is a 51 yo male presenting with ETOH and opiate
intoxication started on narcan gtt and quickly became awake and
resonsive. Stable, he was medically cleared for discharge.

BY PROBLEM
# Opiate Intoxication: Pt reported taking multiple oxycodone and
oxycontin-unsure how many. Was on narcan gtt at 0.4mg/hr and
become alert and oriented. This issue has resolved. In fact, he
has severe pain at baseline and he is now on narcotics for his
pain. He was discharged to a treatment facility for dual
diagnosis.

# ETOH Intoxication: Pt reports no ETOH since [**6-19**] and this
being first drink since that time. His ETOH level was 125. We
searched room, found beer, disposed of beer
He was on Valium PRN for a CIWA score>10, though his CIWA was
persistently 0.

# HIV: records were obtained from [**Hospital1 **] with regards to his
HAART regimen and he was started back on them. He has severe HIV
dementia. he was discharged on HAART, bactrim ppx and namenda.

# Mood Disorder: pt kept on home remeron and lamotrigine doses.
Certainly this is

# Thrombocytosis: the patient's platelet count has been
pesistently elevated since [**5-21**] and have been as high as 659
and were 530 on [**11-1**]. This could be related to his history of
splenectomy, autoimmune thrombocytosis or essential
thrombocytosis. If clinically indicated, may want to pursue
aspirin prophylaxis and JAK2 testing,

# Hepatitis C - no active issues. Testing of liver function was
normal (albumin 4.1) and transaminases negative (no active
inflammaion)

TO BE RESOLVED
1) Sobriety - pt has severe substance abuse problems
2) HIV - pt needs consistent f/u regarding HAART, prohpylaxis
3) MOOD DISORDERS - continue psych follow up
4) Thrombocytosis - continue to follow platelet count; likely
post-splenectomy but further workup as needed

History of Present Illness:
46 yo female with med hx of depression, suicide attempt, COPD,
admitted to [**Hospital3 **] [**3-9**] after being found minimallly
responsive by neighbor. She reported slipping on the ice
multiple times during the past snow storm, and reported left arm
pain and bilat LE pain. She denied CP, CT, or SOB but reported
general malaise. She took increasing doses of both trazadone and
Klonopin overnight due to insomnia from discomfort which is her
last memory. On arrival EMS found empty pill bottles of
seroquel, percocet, and trazodone and OD was suspected. In the
ED at OSH VS were stable but ABG revealed resp acidosis and they
decided to intubate her for airway protection. She was given
activated charcoal for suspected ingestion. Labs revealed an
elevated WBC 17 so she was started on ceftriaxone and
zithromycin for possible PNA. CT head also revealed a rt
parietal hypodensity. LFT revealed a transamiinitis thought to
be due to APAP so NAC was started although tox screen negative
for tylenol but positive for amphetamines. She was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-10**] where she remained intubated. In regards to
transaminitis hepatology saw the pt and recomended NAC and RUQ
U/S which revealed cirrhosis. Transaminases continued to trend
down without further intervention. Parietal hypodensity on CT
was evaluated by nuerology who recommended BP control and ASA.
Pt also had an NSTEMI on admission with trop .32 but heparin gtt
held due to parietal lesion which on [**3-14**] MRI showed slight
hemorrhagic transformation. She continued to spike fevers
despite above antibiotics so on [**3-15**] vancomycin started for
possible endocarditis and TTE showed a severly depressed EF
20-30% but no valvular lesions. CTPA was obtained to rule out PE
as source and blood, sputum and urine cultures were neg. On
admission creat mildly elevated and had high CK's suggestive of
rhabdomylosis but this resolved with IV hydration. CT thorax
showed bullae and pt had autopeep on the ventilator so was
started on IV solumedrol which was weaned to oral prednisone
after extubation. Pt was extubated on [**3-17**] and VS remained
stable. Due to neck pain which was possibly chronic ortho spine
was consulted and afte MRI spine revealed possible ligamentous
injury they recommended C-spine use until follow-up in clinic.
Psychiatry was called once pt extubated and recommended 1:1
sitter and she was called out to the floor for further medical
management.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2176-3-14**] 10:42 AM
There is an area of restricted diffusion within the right
parietal lobe. There is susceptibility within the same region on
gradient-echo images and increased T2 signal. No new areas of
restricted diffusion are seen. There is no significant mass
effect, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
There are multiple air-fluid levels and mucosal thickening
within the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses.
There is no hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysmal
dilatation of the visualized vasculature.

Brief Hospital Course:
46F who presented with fulminant hepatitis status post likely
acetaminophen overdose (including narcotics and amphetamines)
with history of depression and suicide attempts.

CVA-PT had no residual deficits on peripheral neuro exam. CT
head read suggested old infarct although MR head more consistent
with mild hemmorhage. MRA head showed no stenosis in ant or post
circulation and no afib as risk for cardiac thrombus and no
thrombus seen on TTE with repeat showing normal EF and no
thrombus. Carotid U/S was neg but likely source was LV thrombus
post MI although difficult to interpret repeat TTE results. We
controlled her BP with ACE-I which were titrated as blood
pressure tolerated and added ASA 325mg for MI prophylaxis. No
need for anticoagulation at this time per Neurology and
Cardiology consulatation given her recovery in LVEF and risk fo
hemmorrhage due to poor med compliance as an outpt. Pt is
medically clear from a neurological standpoint at this time with
plan for only ASA 325mg qd and outpatient follow-up with
Neurology which will be handled by her PCP.

CAD-large hypokinetic areas on TTE suggest large infarct and ECG
suggested evolving anteroseptal MI although repeat TTE shows
normal EF. We continue ASA as above, Lisinopril now at 10mg and
B blocker at 25mg qd due to normal BP's. Pt with borderline LDL
panel prior to staring statin so cont on 10mg qd. Pt had small
residual effusion on CXR although no further need for diuresis
with pt having adequate O2 sats on room air. Per cardiology pt
will need elective low intesity stress test in 6 weeks, but with
new TTE results prognosis is much better. Pt is medically clear
from a cardiac standpoint to DC home.

Hepatitis-LFT's trended back to normal limits with only NAC.
Most likely drug induced with multiple inciting factors
including APAP in percocet, trazadone, klonopin. Antismooth
muscle Ab pos suggetive of autoimmune hep although [**Doctor First Name **] neg. IgG
and Igm at normal levels, [**Doctor First Name **] neg, hepatitis A,B,C serologies
neg. Unclear what etiology of nodularity of liver on RUQ in pt
who refuses EtOH use and Hep serologies neg.

Elevated WBC-Now normalized and pt afebrile. [**Month (only) 116**] be due to
demargination from steroid use although previous fevers suggest
other etiology. She did not complete a course of any of her
antibiotics although fevers resolved while in MICU. Pt had
increasing sputum production and fevers which have resovled
since starting levofloxacin and will continue [**9-11**] day course of
levofloxacin for PNA with CXR from yesterday clear.

Ingestion -?suicide attempt although pt's ability to make good
decisions is questionable at baseline. Psychiatry is following
and recommended 1:1 sitter and now report that she will need an
inpatient psychiatry stay. Will consult with BEST team regarding
placement.

Anxiety-Started Klonopin as above so stopped ativan. Pt out of
window of withdrawal at this point. Holding on seroquel and
trazadone per psychiatry.
Hip pain-Pain regimen as an outpt included 150mg MS contin [**Hospital1 **]
with percocet for breakthrough as confirmed with PCP DR [**Last Name (STitle) 26909**]
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 35930**]. Pt seen by pain clinic at [**Hospital1 2025**] but not since [**2172**].
Hip films suggest no fracture and read on MRI is no pathology on
side of pain. Pain well controlled on current regimen of MS
contin 60mg tid and 15mg of IR for breakthrough with neurontin
for possible neuropathic component as recommended by pain
consult and now on tylenol.

C-spine-Neck pain appears to be chronic although MRI Cspine
suggestive of possible bone bruising involving C5 spinous
process with contusion of the ligaments attached to the spinous
process and posterior soft tissue swelling. Orthospine consulted
and recommended f/u flexion and extension films which we were
neg so C-collar removed. Pt will have orthopedic follow-up as an
outpt.
COPD-Pt has long smoking hx and cont wheeze on PE. Pt on
steroids for >1wk so will need slower taper now at 5 mg
prednisone qd but will discontinue tomorrow. Cont ipratropium
and albuterol nebs with MDI's but all as prn. Pt CXR of severe
COPD and likely has baseline low O2 sats but is not tachypneic.
PCP is aware and will schedule pulmonary follow-up as an
outpatient.

Anemia-Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease. B12 and
folate normal. Hct stable so no acute need for workup including
bone marrow biopsy

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient presented with a
chief complaint of chest pain.  The patient is a 45-year-old
man with a history of type 1 diabetes status post renal
transplant 20 years ago, with a history of known CAD with two
stents in the right coronary artery and the left circumflex
artery done in [**2119**], who presented on the day of admission
with exertional chest pain that began at 11 a.m. the day of
admission.  The patient had climbed a flight of stairs with
noted increased dyspnea on exertion, although he also
reported a one month history of dyspnea on exertion prior to
admission as well.

Approximately 10 minutes after the patient climbed the
stairs, he developed substernal and epigastric chest pain
that radiated to the left arm and back.  The patient
complained of back pain that was [**2126-7-25**], which decreased to
[**3-27**] after Morphine was given to the patient in the Emergency
Room.  The patient denied any nausea, vomiting, or
diaphoresis, or shortness of breath at rest.  The patient
described the pain as a pressure that was constant and which
felt heavy.

Upon further questioning by the initial primary medical team,
it was described that the patient had a report of this
similar type of chest pain ever since his stents had been
placed in [**2119**] and had recurrent pain of this sort every six
months.  The patient had been told in the past that it was
due to GERD, but stated that he did not believe this
diagnosis.  The patient also noted that nitroglycerin never
helped, and only gave him a headache.  The patient reported
that since he had been on methadone for chronic pain in the
past and on admission, that he needed increased and very high
amounts of Morphine to treat this pain.

The patient noted that he had just recently moved from
[**State 15946**], but had not experienced any colds or flus, no
vomiting, no nausea, no diarrhea, no constipation.

[**Name (NI) **] [**Hospital 982**] Clinic.  The patient has one son.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Heart rate 98, blood
pressure of 116/50 or 86.  In the left arm, the blood
pressure is 119/73.  In the right arm, it was 124/81.  The
patient's temperature was 98.4, respiratory rate was 16, and
he was saturating 96 percent on room air.  His exam showed
that he was in no apparent distress.  His HEENT exam showed
that he has no reactive pupils.  Sclerae were anicteric.  His
neck showed jugular venous distention at 8 cm.  His chest was
clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes were noted.
His heart exam showed regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1,
S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  His abdominal exam was
mildly distended, normoactive bowel sounds, no
hepatosplenomegaly was noted.  His skin exam showed no
rashes.  His neurologic exam showed that he was alert and
oriented times three.  He has [**5-22**] motor strength in his upper
and lower extremities, and his sensory examination was
grossly intact.  His extremities showed [**1-19**] dorsalis pedis
pulses.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count of 8.8, hematocrit of
44.9, platelets of 358.  His sodium is 136, potassium was
6.1.  This was hemolyzed and redrawn, and the repeat
potassium was 3.5, bicarb of 24, BUN of 20, and a creatinine
of 1.2.  Patient's glucose was 122.  His initial set of
cardiac enzymes showed a CK of 135, MB of 2, and troponin
less than 0.01.

The patient's EKG on admission showed sinus rhythm with a
heart rate at 95, normal intervals, normal axis, poor R-wave
progression, Q in lead III, and otherwise no acute ST-T
changes.

The patient's chest x-ray showed a widen mediastinum.  The
patient then received chest and abdominal CT scan, which
showed a normal thoracic aorta, no mediastinal or hilar
lymphadenopathy, and an abdominal aorta within normal limits.
The transplanted kidney was incompletely imaged, however,
there were no significant abnormalities, according to the
Radiology [**Location (un) 1131**].  It was also noted in the chest CT that
there were these 2 mm noncalcified pulmonary nodules in the
right upper lobe and right lower lobe.  Of note, the patient
reported that he had ""fatty nodules"" in his lungs that have
been noted and have remained stable since his renal
transplant 20 years prior to admission.

According to the patient's physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] in [**State 15946**],
the patient had received P-MIBI in the year [**2118**], which
showed a small inferior wall defect and underwent a cardiac
catheterization with a distal right stent and a mid circ
stent on [**2118-8-31**].  Several months later the patient
then had another P-MIBI, which showed a negative study, an EF
of over 60 percent.  Patient was also noted to have a history
of MRSA from a groin abscess in the past.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Room, the patient had been
given IV Morphine with relief of the patient's chest pain.
The patient was then admitted first to the Medicine service.
While in the Medicine service, patient underwent a P-MIBI on
[**5-31**], which was positive for inferior reversible defect.
On [**6-3**], the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization,
where he was found a right coronary artery restent thrombosis
and stenosis.  The patient had this restented with a Cypher
stent.

On [**6-3**] after the catheterization had been completed, the
patient was noted to have a new expressive aphasia, and there
is a concern for a new embolic stroke as a result.  The
Neurology consult service was notified and recommended
carotid studies and head CT.  The patient underwent two
negative head CT scans, and carotid studies that showed
normal flow.  The patient was started on a Heparin drip as
per Neurology recommendations.  It was recommended by the
Neurology team that the patient undergo a transesophageal
echocardiogram, however, since the patient complained of
dysphagia, the patient first underwent an EGD on [**6-4**].

The EGD showed that the patient was noted to have a
Schatski's ring, and although this was widely patent.

On [**6-5**], the patient was noted to have an acute event
consisting of temperature spike to 102 degrees, worsening
mental status, and continued aphasia, hypoxia with an ABG on
face mask of 7.43/41/51, and the patient was then transferred
to the ICU on the opposite campus.  The patient was never
intubated and his hypoxia resolved on his first day in the
ICU.  The patient was noted to have a multilobar pneumonia as
shown on a chest x-ray that was done on [**6-5**], and patient
was started on IV antibiotics including IV vancomycin and IV
Zosyn.  The patient also had sputum cultures that were drawn,
which showed gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci in
pairs and clusters.  These eventually returned with as
speciosities that showed that the patient did have MRSA in
his sputum.  By the time the sensitivities returned, the
patient had already completed seven days of IV Zosyn and this
was discontinued.  The patient was continued, however, on his
IV vancomycin as he did have MRSA in his sputum that grew
out.

While in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was noted to
have resolving symptoms of his expressive aphasia and by his
second day in the ICU, the patient's mental status had
returned to baseline.  The patient did undergo a
transesophageal echocardiogram on [**6-7**], which showed a
small atrial septal defect with no thrombus noted.

The Cardiology service initially recommended anticoagulation
and the patient was started on a Heparin drip and later on
Coumadin.  The Cardiology service did note that the patient
was not in ASD closure candidate given all of his multiple
comorbidities.  The Neurology team was then re consulted with
the question of whether or not anticoagulation should be
continued in this patient given his ASD with left-to-right
flow.

The Neurology attending, after extensive discussion between
the Medical team and the Neurology attending, it was decided
that the patient did not require anticoagulation as the
patient's changes in his neurological status were more likely
consistent with a renewal of his old stroke.  The patient's
head CT scans had shown evidence of an old stroke in the
past, and the Neurology attending felt that the patient's
transient expressive aphasia was most likely consistent with
a renewal of the patient's old stroke symptoms given his
acute medical stressors at the time.

The Neurology attending felt that the patient could be
discontinued on the anticoagulation, however, should be
continued on the aspirin and Plavix.  The Neurology attending
also felt the patient should follow up in the
Neuro/Cardiology Clinic 1-2 weeks after discharge from the
skilled-nursing facility for further workup as an outpatient
of hypercoagulability state.  The patient was also told to
followup with the Neuro/Cardiology Clinic by the Cardiology
service as well.

The patient's other problems included:  1. [**Name2 (NI) 1194**]:  The patient
had a history of chronic rectal pain for which he had been
placed on standing methadone b.i.d.  The patient continued to
have episodes of recurrent chest pain after he was
transferred from the Intensive Care Unit once he was stable
to the Medical floor.  Multiple EKGs were done in the several
days prior to the patient's discharge, and all of them showed
no changes in the patient's EKG from his baseline.  The
patient was then again ruled out for myocardial infarction
for a second time three days prior to his discharge from the
hospital.

The patient continued to report that he had a chronic level
of chest pain at all times, however, when he became anxious,
the chest pain would become more intense.  The patient had
described the chest pain as starting from his neck either the
right or the left, and occasionally migrating to his
substernal or left substernal area.  The patient also
reported that only Morphine relieved the pain, and the
patient did not receive nitroglycerin when the chest pain
rose since he had a RCA stent that was placed.

In light of the patient's chest pain that did not show any
evidence of changes on EKG or any evidence of myocardial
infarction as shown by his cardiac enzymes, the patient also
had his clonazepam dose increased from 0.5 t.i.d. prn
eventually to 1 mg p.o. t.i.d.  The patient was also given
prn doses of subQ Morphine every 4-6 hours 1-2 mg each time.
The patient also continued to report a headache, although
this was relieved by starting Ultram for the patient.  The
patient was also reported having low back pain at the site of
his lumbar punctures that were done by the Neurology service
after the patient had an expressive aphasia.  Although the LP
results were negative, the patient continued to report pain
at the site of the LP.

The patient underwent imaging studies for the low back pain,
which did not show any acute defect, compression, or
fracture.  The patient's lumbar puncture site was also noted
never to be edematous, have a fluid collection, to be
erythematous, or to be warm.  The patient was started on
Tylenol 1 gram q.6h. for the patient's low back pain.
According to the patient, these combination of medications
did relieve his pain in his low back area, his headache, his
chest pain, and his rectal pain.  At the time of discharge,
the patient was on the combination of Tylenol 1 gram q.6h.,
Ultram prn, methadone 10 mg p.o. b.i.d., and subQ Morphine
every six hours 1 mg each time.  The patient was told that he
would be eventually transitioned to p.o. pain medication if
he required additional pain management control.

1. Dysphagia:  The patient reported a history of dysphagia
   and underwent an EGD, which showed a Schatski's ring that
   was widely patent.  The patient also underwent a speech
   and swallow study with a video oropharyngeal study portion
   done showing functional or pharyngeal swallowing mechanism
   without evidence of dysphagia or aspiration.  The patient
   was placed on a regular consistency p.o. diet, with thin
   liquids, as recommended by speech and swallow.  The
   patient was also told that he should have an outpatient
   gastric emptying study performed at some point as an
   outpatient.

1. Renal transplant:  The patient was status post renal
   transplant 20 years ago by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15473**] at [**Hospital1 20311**].  The patient is currently on
   azathioprine and prednisone for the patient's status post
   transplant condition.  The patient was followed by the
   renal transplant fellow while in-house.  The patient's
   creatinine decreased from 1.2 on admission and on
   discharge it was 0.8, and the patient's creatinine
   remained stable throughout the majority of his hospital
   stay.  From the Renal Transplant team perspective, the
   patient's never had any acute renal problems or issues.

1. Diabetes:  The patient has a history of type 1 diabetes
   and is on an insulin pump that is managed by the patient
   and the patient's wife at home.  The patient was noted to
   have labile sugars while in the ICU that necessitated
   insulin drip.  The patient was eventually weaned off the
   insulin drip, and was followed by the [**Hospital **] Clinic while
   in-house.  The patient was placed on a Glargine and
   Humalog sliding scale by the [**Last Name (un) **] clinicians.  On
   discharge, the patient was on Glargine 28 units at
   breakfast and an insulin-sliding scale.

According to the [**Last Name (un) **] attending on discharge, the patient
should resume his insulin pump once at the skilled-nursing
facility and/or rehab.  The patient should also continue
using the insulin pump once he returns to home.

1. Heme:  The patient had a decrease in his hematocrit from
   30 to 26 during his hospital stay and he received 2 units
   of packed red blood cells with an appropriate increase in
   his hematocrit from 26  to 33.  The patient was guaiac
   negative during his hospital stay and showed no evidence
   of bleeding at any point.  The patient's hematocrit
   remains stable in the low 30s after the blood transfusion.

1. Lung nodules:  The patient was noted to have incidental
   calcified lung nodules on his CT on admission.  It was
   recommended by the team that the patient have a followup
   CT in a few months for his noncalcified lung nodules.
   Patient had a PPD that was placed during hospital stay
   that was negative.

1. GI:  The patient initially presented with constipation and
   was placed on a bowel medication regimen.  During the last
   four days of his hospital stay, the patient had
   intermittent episodes of diarrhea.  The patient did have
   three Clostridium difficile tests sent.  The first two of
   three Clostridium difficile cultures were negative.  The
   patient also had stool cultures sent, and these were also
   pending at the time of discharge.

1. Psychiatric issues:  The patient has a history of
   depression and anxiety, and is on BuSpar, clonazepam, and
   Paxil at home.  The patient had these medications
   temporarily stopped while in the ICU.  These were
   restarted once the patient was again transferred back to
   the Medicine floor.  As the patient experienced multiple
   episodes of anxiety throughout his hospital stay
   manifesting with chest pain at times, the patient had his
   clonazepam increased from 0.5 mg t.i.d. to 1 mg t.i.d.

1. Coronary artery disease:  As mentioned previously, the
   patient received a cardiac catheterization during his
   hospital stay, where he was found to have a instent
   restenosis of his right coronary artery and had a new
   Cypher stent placed.  Given his coronary artery disease,
   the patient was started on simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
   The patient was also started on an ACE inhibitor and on
   discharge, the patient was on captopril 12.5 mg p.o.
   t.i.d.  The patient had his atenolol or metoprolol dose
   increased to 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. during his hospital stay,
   and also was sent to rehab on aspirin and Plavix.

1. Access:  The patient had a right subclavian central line
   placed on [**6-5**], which was discontinued prior to
   discharge.  Given that the patient required IV vancomycin
   antibiotics for seven days after discharge, the patient
   had a PICC placed by Interventional Radiology on the day
   prior to discharge.

1. FEN:  The patient was placed on the cardiac, diabetic diet
   regular consistency with thin liquids.  The patient had
   electrolytes repleted as necessary.

1. Prophylaxis:  The patient was placed on a proton-pump
   inhibitor and a bowel regimen.  The patient was initially
   on a Heparin drip, however, after the Neurology attending
   and Cardiology felt that this was no longer necessary,
   this was discontinued.  The patient was then seen by
   Physical Therapy and the patient ambulated daily.

History of Present Illness:
81yo male with Depression, Anxiety, HTN, and Factor [**Doctor First Name 81**]
deficiency was found unresponsive by family.  Pt has apparently
been depressed as of late and has been giving things away over
the past week.  The patient told his wife he was going to take a
nap at noon on [**2131-12-1**].  His wife was unable to rouse him at
2PM and then at 4PM.  At this time, the wife became concerned
and called his daughter who subsequently called 911.  The EMS
found him unresponsive except to painful stimuli with pinpoint
pupils, unable to protect his airway.  EMS failed to intubated
him in the field, and gave narcan without effect.
   Pt arrived at the [**Hospital1 18**] ED where he was found to be
hypertensive to 240s/110s, with SaO2 at 100% on NRB.  The
patient received lidocaine, vecuronium, fentanyl, etomidate,
propofol and was intubated.  Pt had a head CT which was read as
negative for bleed and a gastric lavage with activated charcoal.
The patient was started on a nipride gtt for his HTN which was
eventually weaned off.
   The son later brought in pill bottles and 92 pills of 1mg
Xanax, 25 tablets of 5mg of Ambien, and an undisclosed amount of
Remeron, were found to be missing.  As per the son, the pt was
in his usual state of health, no fever, chills, rigors, weight
loss, physical complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 81 year old male with history of depression and anxiety was
found unresponsive after ""going for a nap.""  No distinct
toxidrome was evident in presentation.

In ICU, GCS was 5.  The primary ingestion was benzodiazepine
(Xanax), approximately 92pills of 1mg of Xanax, 25 pills of 5mg
ambien and unknown quantity of remeron.  Patient required
respiratory support briefly in the intensive care unit, and
subsequently awoke without any sequelae.  Urine toxicologic
analysis positive only for benzodiazepines.

Upon awakening, patient noted that he knew that he took several
more pills than usual but ""thought it would help him relax,"" and
denies suicidal intent nor ideation.  Patient's family reports
that they have found suicide notes and letters, and patient has
been giving away prized belongings.

The patient is positive for 6 of SIGECAPS criteria.  He denies
current suicidal ideation.  The patient was observed on the
medical floor for medical clearance prior to transfer to
inpatient psychiatry.  During this time he received a 1:1
continuous sitter.

Psychiatric consultation was obtained, and felt patient has
major depression with an acute, severe suicide attempt with high
likelihood of success.  He will require inpatient psychiatric
hospitalization with longitudinal followup.

Metabolic Alkalosis:  Most likely due to suctioning of GI
content as well as from toxin ingestion.  Resolved by discharge.

Endocrine - Nonelevated glucose.  TSH WNL.
Paratracheal stripe on CXR:  re-imaged with CT, demonstrating no
concerning masses.  Possible paraneoplastic syndrome - thyroid
studies as well.

Onc - History of lymphoma, possibly treated with radiotherapy in
past.  Patient denies any current nor past chemotherapy.

HTN: Initial hypertension resolved to stable Stage I
hypertension (SBP ~135-145)

PPx: sub Q heparin TID, lansoprazole, and bowel regimen in
hospital.
